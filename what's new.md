## Breaking changes

- Fixing support for R and RG texture formats made us remove TextureFormat_R32F and TextureFormat_RG32F as they were mixing formats and types. Please, use the respective TextureFormat_R and TextureFormat_RG with the Float types ([sebavan](http://www.github.com/sebavan))
- Replacing `scene.onRenderingGroupObservable` by `onBeforeRenderingGroupObservable` and `onAfterRenderingGroupObservable` to prevent the stage check ([sebavan](http://www.github.com/sebavan))
- Replacing `IActiveMeshCandidateProvider` and the according scene setter by a set of custom predicates `scene.getActiveMeshCandidates`, `scene.getActiveSubMeshCandidates`, `scene.getIntersectingSubMeshCandidates` and `scene.getCollidingSubMeshCandidates` ([sebavan](http://www.github.com/sebavan)). This helps opening more customization to everybody.
