## CDN

To look into our CDN bundled distribution, you can refer to the package [babylonjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babylonjs)

## npm

BabylonJS and its modules are published on npm as esNext modules with full typing support. To install, use:

```text
npm install @babylonjs/core --save
```

This will allow you to import BabylonJS entirely using:

```javascript
import * as BABYLON from "@babylonjs/core/Legacy/legacy";
```

or individual classes to benefit from enhanced tree shaking using :

```javascript
import { Scene } from "@babylonjs/core/scene";
import { Engine } from "@babylonjs/core/Engines/engine";
```

To add a module, install the respective package. A list of extra packages and their installation instructions can be found on the [babylonjs user on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~babylonjs) scoped on @babylonjs.

## Usage

See [our ES6 dedicated documentation](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/es6_support):

```javascript
import { Engine } from "@babylonjs/core/Engines/engine";
import { Scene } from "@babylonjs/core/scene";
import { Vector3 } from "@babylonjs/core/Maths/math";
import { FreeCamera } from "@babylonjs/core/Cameras/freeCamera";
import { HemisphericLight } from "@babylonjs/core/Lights/hemisphericLight";

// Side-effects only imports allowing the standard material to be used as default.
import "@babylonjs/core/Materials/standardMaterial";
// import the individual builders or use MeshBuilder to have them all
import { CreateSphere } from "@babylonjs/core/Meshes/Builders/sphereBuilder";
import { CreateGround } from "@babylonjs/core/Meshes/Builders/groundBuilder";

const canvas = document.getElementById("renderCanvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;
const engine = new Engine(canvas);
var scene = new Scene(engine);

// This creates and positions a free camera (non-mesh)
var camera = new FreeCamera("camera1", new Vector3(0, 5, -10), scene);

// This targets the camera to scene origin
camera.setTarget(Vector3.Zero());

// This attaches the camera to the canvas
camera.attachControl(canvas, true);

// This creates a light, aiming 0,1,0 - to the sky (non-mesh)
var light = new HemisphericLight("light1", new Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);

// Default intensity is 1. Let's dim the light a small amount
light.intensity = 0.7;

// Our built-in 'sphere' shape. Params: name, options, scene
var sphere = CreateSphere("sphere1", { segments: 16, diameter: 2 }, scene);

// Move the sphere upward 1/2 its height
sphere.position.y = 2;

// Our built-in 'ground' shape. Params: name, options, scene
CreateGround("ground1", { width: 6, height: 6, subdivisions: 2 }, this._scene);

engine.runRenderLoop(() => {
    scene.render();
});
```
