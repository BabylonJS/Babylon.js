+ added FI_ConvertTo16Bits (555 and 565)

June 1th 2000 - 1.3.1
- removed Standard Template Library (STL) code
* [Jani Kajala] fixed minor bug in FI_LoadTARGA
* [Jani Kajala] fixed some minor bugs in FI_LoadPCX
! streamlined FI_LoadJPEG a little
! FreeImage now uses LibPNG 1.0.6
! FreeImage now uses LibTIFF 3.5.5
! FreeImage now uses malloc and free instead of new and delete
+ introduced compiler flags to disable certain features in the DLL
+ added experimental nearest color reduction (FI_ReduceColorsNearestColor)

April 13th 2000 - 1.3.0
* fixed some 8 bit PCX files loading incorrectly
* fixed tiny bug in internally used CalculateUsedColors function
- removed FI_SaveXPM. Only BMP is supported now.
- removed Windows dependencies for easier porting
! optimized FI_LoadKOALA a little
! optimized FI_Combine using MMX technology
! FI_Combine now receives an 'unsigned integer' as alpha blend parameter
! FI_InCreaseColors and FI_ReduceColors don't dispose the old bitmap anymore
+ added PNM support (PGM, PPM and PBM; both binary and ascii)
+ [Alexander Dymerets] added FI_EnableMMX and FI_DisableMMX
+ added various effect functions (FI_Blur, FI_Brighten and FI_Crop)

March 1st 2000 - 1.2.1
* fixed some 24 bit PCX files loading incorrectly

February 8th 2000 - 1.2.0
* fixed last bitmap data block in JPEG files being truncated
* fixed 4/8 bit BMP's incorrectly loading when the palette is smaller than the bitcount predicts
- removed FI_Load. There is no reliable way to identify all image formats
- removed FI_SetJpegDecodeMode.
   Mode selection is now done using the 'DataEnum data' parameter of FI_LoadJPEG
! read_proc/write_proc/tell_proc in FreeImageIO now are same as fread/fwrite/ftell
+ added a 'DataEnum data' parameter to all FI_LoadXXX functions.
+ added 16 bit TARGA support
+ added RLE support for TARGA images
+ added FI_GetDIBSize to get the size of a DIB in bytes
+ added Kodak PhotoCD support (Base, Base/4 and Base/16 encoding)
+ added KOALA support
+ added FI_GetFileType. Note: there is no reliable way to identify TARGA, ICO and PCD. Therefore they have been excluded
In KOALA files only the files converted by a C64 emulator can be identified.
+ added FI_Combine to combine two 24-bit bitmaps with (optional) alpha blending

January 15th 2000 - 1.1.1
! FI_Copy is now called FI_Clone
+ added FI_ToGrayscale to convert a color bitmap to grayscale
+ added 32 bit TARGA support
+ added FI_IncreaseColors to increase the bitmap bitdepth from 4/8 bit to 24 bit

January 14th 2000 - 1.1.0
* FI_MIRROR: fixed nibbles not being mirrored in 4 bit images
* FI_MIRROR: fixed bits not being mirrored in 1 bit images
* fixed improper loading of 1, 4 and 8 bit OS/2 BMP's
* fixed some inconsistensies in the calculation of lines and pitches
* fixed incorrectly loading of Huffman and FAX encoded TIFFs
* fixed LoadTGA accepting 16 bit TGA's and returning corrupt DIB's
- removed LZW support for TIFFs
! FreeImage now uses LibTIFF 3.5.4
+ added ICO support
+ added overridable file I/O support in the form of FreeImageIO and fi_handle
+ added FI_Load for generic image loading
+ added FI_ReduceColors for color reduction
+ added FI_Copy to copy a bitmap in memory

January 5th 2000 - 1.0.0
