NUnit 2.x is needed for FreeImage .NET wrapper unit tests. It can be
downloaded from http://www.nunit.org/

After installing NUnit, double click on the NUnit project file
FreeImage.NET.nunit located in the FreeImage .NET wrapper Source folder
to load the project.

The FreeImage .NET wrapper unit test project UnitTest.csproj, located
under Source\UnitTest, must be compiled in 'Debug' mode prior to opening
the NUnit project.

The FreeImage .NET wrapper unit test project UnitTest.csproj currently
relies on the FreeImage .NET wrapper single source file, created by the
Source File Merger, located in the Source\SourceFileMerger folder.
