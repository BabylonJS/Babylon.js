                "description": "See https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/babylon-blendshapes-animation-player-fps-drops-and-glitch/41884/13.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows to set a maximum number of active targets, to avoid a shader recompilation each time the number of active targets changes. If non-zero, we compile the shader with `NUM_MORPH_INFLUENCERS=this value`, and `NUM_MORPH_INFLUENCERS` is used as the upper bound of a loop over the targets. We use a uniform variable to break from the loop when we reach the number of active targets.\r\n\r\nNote that for WebGPU / WGSL, up to now, we didn't have a mean to make preprocessing variable replacements (we didn't need it)! When defining something like `#define TEST 23`, `TEST` could be used in a `#if` / `#ifdef` / `#elif` statement, but not as a replacement like in `int test = TEST;`. It works in WebGL because such replacements are automatically handled by the GLSL parser/compiler (there's no specific code in Babylon to do it).\r\n\r\nSo, I added this feature in WebGPU, but the replacement variable name should be enclosed inside $...$ (I can change the enclosing character!). I did it this way because I think this code would be too time consuming:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst defineToValue: { [key: string]: string } = {};\r\n// fill defineToValue with the replacement variables\r\ncode.replace(/(\\w+)/g, (_, p1) => {\r\n    return defineToValue[p1] ?? p1;\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThis would mean hundred or thousand (or more!) of replacements (because `(\\w+)` will match a lot of time) + the possibility of wrong replacements (in case a replacement variable is a subset of a string).",

In the case of streaming sounds, playback fails in Chrome with `DOMException: The play method is not allowed by the user agent` ... **but the audio context is not suspended**. Since the audio engine assumes the audio context is `suspended`, the current `AudioEngine.unlock()` implementation fails when the audio context state is actually `running`.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes the `AudioEngine.unlock()` issue by setting `AudioEngine.unlocked` to `true` and notifying `onAudioUnlockedObservable` observers when the audio context state is `running`.\r\n\r\nTested on playground https://playground.babylonjs.com/#BB4105#1.",

                "description": "been working with gizmo manager for a quite a while and it's super painful to check if we're dragging a gizmo (gizmo axis or bounding box sphere/cubes) so I added a isDragging variable for that. \r\n\r\nwhile on it, a releaseDrag method both on each gizmo (position, rotation, scale,boundingBox) and on gizmo manager can be quite handy and will save the developers so much time. \r\n\r\nalso, we can attach mesh/node but if we want to get that specific mesh/node we have to check which gizmo is enabled and get the data from there. so I added getters for the attachedMesh and attachedNode.",

                "description": "Fixes #12441\n\nThe webxr session manager now has a world scaling factor that allows to set the units in which your world is defined. i.e., if, in your world, 1 unit is 1 cm, you would define the factor to be 100. the native XR component will still maintain the 1 unit 1 meter relation, but the data from and to XR are scaled correctly according to the scale factor.\n\nControllers and hands are scaled as well. So is the teleportation ring.\n\nNote - any other values should be scaled by the dev itself. For example, the ray's distance will be in world scale. Another example - to define gestures for the hands components you would need to use the components' absolute position and scale the distances accordingly.",

Four sampler2D textures are used to store `covA`, `covB`, `centers`, and `colors`. These textures will not be changed after initialization.\r\n2. `splatIndex` attribute are used to store the sorting index of splats, and it is the only instance attribute to be changed after each sorting.\r\n3. positions are only post to worker once, only `_modelViewMatrix` is updated often\r\n\r\nWith the modification above, [large dataset](https://projects.markkellogg.org/threejs/assets/data/truck/truck_high.ksplat) could be rendered with fps 60, which is originally around 15.",

                "description": "# Changes\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new module, \"ObjectModel\", and interfaces, whose main objective is to perform the conversion between a string \"path\" and a object that can be manipulated. This is useful for some glTF extensions, such as Interactivity and Animation Pointer. For example, an Animation Pointer path, such as `/nodes/0/translation` is converted to a list of AnimationProperty objects which are used to construct a Babylon animation.\r\n\r\nThis translation is performed by the implementers of an interface IPathToObjectConverter, whose method `convert` takes a path and returns this special object. There are three implementations of it. One (FlowGraphPathConverter) is aimed to resolve paths in the FlowGraphContext, and two are aimed to resolve glTF paths.\r\n\r\nAs part of this change, the existing FlowGraphPath class was deleted, as its functionality is superseded by the FlowGraphPathConverter class. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the KHR_animation_pointer class was slightly tweaked to use its path converter.",

At the time, only Canary supports it. You must enable the feature at runtime by doing `engine.enableGPUTimingMeasurements = true` (will do nothing in WebGL of course!).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/assets/4152247/e06e6beb-9ea1-4b5b-a5e2-008b69cb8385)\r\n\r\nI also performed some changes so that we don't generate errors for mapped buffers when the device is destroyed.\r\n",

The rest of the math nodes will be added later.\r\n- GetProperty node was added.\r\n- Some nodes had input values moved to configuration values, such as the GetVariable node.",

It's a bit ugly but creating another function was the only way I could see to avoid duplicating lots of code.\r\nTo mimic the dispersion effect, I compute the refraction coords 3 times with slightly different IOR's and then sample the environment refraction with each of these. The final refraction is a combination of R from the first, G from the second and B from the last.\r\n<img width=\"670\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-07 at 4 26 55 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/assets/1069125/34daa5bb-7225-4014-8bae-8c35c75392b8\">\r\n",

With this, picking a child mesh will lead to any of its parents' picks also being fired. The ordering is that first the child mesh event fires, then the parents, no matter in what order the event blocks were added to the graph. For this, when we start a graph, we need to recompute the order where the event blocks fire for each context. The reordering is done so that, if two FlowGraphMeshPickEventBlocks appear in the ordering, the first one's referenced mesh is a descendant of the second one's reference mesh.",

The main reason this warning should be displayed is in cases where it is not possible to determine the sizes of all controls inside the StackPanel by using just the controls themselves and their children. I'm calling \"fully defined\" the width/height of controls that can be determined using just the size of the control and its children - i.e, the control doesn't depend on its parent for sizing. A regular Control would be fully defined if its size is expressed in pixels instead of percentage. And a Container control would be fully defined if it has `adaptWidth/HeightToChildren` set to true and all its children are fully defined. For a StackPanel, we want its width (in horizontal mode) or height (in vertical mode) to be fully defined, because they adapt to their children. So we display the warning when the corresponding dimension is not fully defined. I didn't reword the warning itself because I couldn't think of a better phrasing, but it might be good to change the phrasing too.",

                "title": "Flow graph path",
                "description": "# Changes\r\nA new class called `FlowGraphPath` was introduced. The intention behind this class is to serve as a generic implementation of the glTF Object Model (https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/d8c3ef5bd9e2054e2caff34c99103953aa29a610/specification/2.0/ObjectModel.adoc), as assets in the interactivity extension are referenced by this model. The path will be resolved against the user variables in the Flow Graph's context. For example, given a context with\r\n```javascript\r\nconst context = new FlowGraphContext(...);\r\ncontext._userVariables = {\r\n a: [ { b: 1 } ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen, `a/0/b` would resolve to the value \"1\". The dot also works as an separator, so `a/0.b` should also resolve to \"1\".\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to perform runtime substitutions with numeric values on these paths. One example would be `a/{runTimeValue}/b`, where `runTimeValue` can be substituted for any number. The string \"runTimeValue\" is called a \"template string\", and nodes created with paths containing template strings will have an input connection for each of these values. A concrete example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst block = new FlowGraphSetPropertyBlock({path: new FlowGraphPath(\"/a/{runTimeValue}/b\")});\r\nblock.getDataInput(\"runTimeValue\").setValue(0, ... );\r\n```\r\nThen, at run-time, the value of the \"runTimeValue\" input would be evaluated, and the string `a/{runTimeValue}/b` resolved as `a/0/b`. Using template strings wouldn't make much sense in this example, as I could just have created the path with the final value I wanted, but if the \"runTimeValue\" input is connected to other data nodes, then we have the dynamic resolution of assets.\r\n\r\nBesides the SetProperty block, other blocks that utilize paths are PlayAnimation and MeshPick. MeshPick is a little special because it is an Event Block - meaning it shouldn't depend on arbitrary input data to function (at least from my understanding - this can be discussed). In this case, it shouldn't receive paths with template strings.\r\n\r\n[EDIT: NEW ADDITION]\r\nTo simplify the common pattern of generating numeric data inputs from a path, and getting those values and substituting them in the path, a new class named FlowGraphPathComponent was added. This class is intended to be a member of blocks that realize this pattern, such as SetProperty or PlayAnimation. So, for example, in the SetProperty constructor:\r\n```javascript\r\npublic constructor(public config: IFlowGraphSetPropertyBlockConfiguration) {\r\n        super(config);\r\n\r\n        this.value = this.registerDataInput(\"value\", RichTypeAny);\r\n        this.templateComponent = new FlowGraphPathComponent(config.path, this);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand in execute:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\npublic _execute(context: FlowGraphContext): void {\r\n        const value = this.value.getValue(context);\r\n        const path = this.templateComponent.substitutePath(context);\r\n        path.setProperty(context, value);\r\n\r\n        this.onDone._activateSignal(context);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome additional changes that ended up being made: on the FlowGraphContext, I switched the `_userVariables`, `_executionVariables`, etc, i.e, the Map values, to be simple Records. The reason for that is just making the nested access in _userVariables easier, and the others were changed to keep the same style. It should have a bonus of not having any overhead from the Map class. \r\n\r\n# Examples\r\nSome PGs that use the paths:\r\n- #KSTQJU#9 - SetProperty with path: click on the left sphere and the right sphere will change position\r\n- #KSTQJU#10 - SetProperty with template string\r\n- #KSTQJU#11 - MeshPick and SetProperty with template string\r\n- #KSTQJU#13 - MeshPick and PlayAnimation with template string\r\n- #GPPEUA#11 - Car semaphore example\r\n",

We will have to wait for an extension that allows to raise this  limit before re-enabling it.\r\n* With the latest version of Chrome (119), I also had to handle depth textures in much the same way as float textures when linear filtering is not supported for them: the sampler type must be forced to \"unfilterable float\" for depth textures in the bind group layout.\r\n* The \"float32-filtering\" extension is now supported by Chrome, which revealed some bugs I had to fix in the code (I had to create a new \"supportFloatTexturesResolve\" caps because WebGPU can currently render to a R32float but not resolve it).\r\n* I fixed a bug with greased lines, which didn't work in WebGPU.\r\n* I've added the visualization tests I used specifically for WebGPU to the regular list (in `config.json`), as it's no problem to have them for WebGL too.",

                "description": "This PR modifies all cameras to take the animation ratio (time to complete a single frame) and uses it to make all camera movements take the same amount of time as 60 FPS (AR of 1).\r\n\r\nUpdate: Since the animation ratio (ratio used to scale inertia and movement offsets) is only updated in `scene.render()`, we had to add a custom timing method for users that have a custom rendering loop/cadence.  This PR also adds the following changes:\r\n\r\n- `PrecisionDate.Now` has been updated to be more efficient\r\n- The variable `constantAnimationDeltaTime` has been added so that users can change the delta time for testing purposes\r\n\r\nPGs Used to Test: \r\n- https://playground.babylonjs.com/#DLIIMQ\r\n- https://playground.babylonjs.com/#DLIIMQ#1\r\n- https://playground.babylonjs.com/#DLIIMQ#3\r\n- https://playground.babylonjs.com/#DLIIMQ#4\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: Because we're now using 1000 / 60 (16.6666...) instead of 16 for the default constant animation ratio, some of the particle tests were broke.  I've updated the PNGs against the new ratio.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the camera to move correctly, regardless of frame rate, I had to create a scaling factor that has to be multiplied against the offsets to be added.  Because the math isn't quite clear as to how the scaling factor is found, here's an explanation:\r\n\r\nGiven the following variables:\r\n**r = initial offset\r\nn = inertia\r\na = relative inertia (with respect to frame deltaTime ratio; currentDeltaTime/standardDeltaTime) = n^t\r\ns = scale factor\r\nt = deltaTime ratio = currentDeltaTime/standardDeltaTime**\r\n\r\nLet's assume that the work to be done for our current frame rate can be represented as `scaleFactor * initial offset * relative inertia` `(inertia ^ (currentDeltaTime/standardDeltaTime))`.  The equivalent amount of time could be represented as the sum _from (1 to t)_ of our `initial offset * inertia^x`\r\nsra = rn^t + ... + rn\r\n\r\nIf we factor out a common value of `rn`, we then have our initial value * the sum of a geometric series.\r\nsra = rn(n^(t-1) + ... + 1)\r\n\r\nWe can also factor out our initial offset\r\nsa = n(n^(t-1) + ... + 1)\r\n\r\nNext, we can substitute the closed formula for the sum of a geometric series\r\nsa = n((n^t - 1) / (n - 1))\r\n\r\nFinally, we set everything equal to s\r\ns = n((n^t - 1) / (n - 1)) / a\r\n\r\nLet's substitute a for n^t and clean up the fractions a bit\r\ns = n * (1/a) * ((a - 1) / (n - 1))\r\n**s = (n/a) * ((a - 1) / (n - 1))**",

Because the math isn't quite clear as to how the scaling factor is found, here's an explanation:\r\n\r\nGiven the following variables:\r\n**r = initial offset\r\nn = inertia\r\na = relative inertia (with respect to frame deltaTime ratio; currentDeltaTime/standardDeltaTime) = n^t\r\ns = scale factor\r\nt = deltaTime ratio = currentDeltaTime/standardDeltaTime**\r\n\r\nLet's assume that the work to be done for our current frame rate can be represented as `scaleFactor * initial offset * relative inertia` `(inertia ^ (currentDeltaTime/standardDeltaTime))`.  The equivalent amount of time could be represented as the sum _from (1 to t)_ of our `initial offset * inertia^x`\r\nsra = rn^t + ... + rn\r\n\r\nIf we factor out a common value of `rn`, we then have our initial value * the sum of a geometric series.\r\nsra = rn(n^(t-1) + ... + 1)\r\n\r\nWe can also factor out our initial offset\r\nsa = n(n^(t-1) + ... + 1)\r\n\r\nNext, we can substitute the closed formula for the sum of a geometric series\r\nsa = n((n^t - 1) / (n - 1))\r\n\r\nFinally, we set everything equal to s\r\ns = n((n^t - 1) / (n - 1)) / a\r\n\r\nLet's substitute a for n^t and clean up the fractions a bit\r\ns = n * (1/a) * ((a - 1) / (n - 1))\r\n**s = (n/a) * ((a - 1) / (n - 1))**",

For example, if the subString is `nodeIndex`, and the path is `/node/{nodeIndex}/`, when this node is activated, it will look into the nodeIndex socket, and substitute its value (which could be 0, then the path would be `/node/0`). This allows dynamic paths that are resolved based on the current state of the scene.\r\n   - This change will be needed because of how the glTF Interactivity uses paths. In some cases, paths are defined as `/node/{nodeIndex}/property`, and we want these paths to be resolved at runtime.\r\n-  The SetProperty node was changed to use a configuration object instead of sockets. The configuration object contains a string path (as defined in the context variables), and a string property, such as translation, rotation, etc.\r\n- I also moved the default serialization and parsing functions to a separate module, and added handling of vector values.\r\n- I also removed the variableDefinitions value, as it wasn't being used and made things more complex.",

                "description": "I added the support as a whole and not to WebGPU specifically, this way it can benefit to any engine that requires that strides be a multiple of 4 bytes (like probably Native does).\r\n\r\nIf the stride is not a multiple of 4 bytes, each time you call `VertexBuffer.update()`, it will create a new GPU buffer. But calling `VertexBuffer.update()` is slow anyway, because we must create a new buffer on the js side to make space for padding data. So, I prefered not to handle this case and simply create a new GPU buffer instead of making the PR more complex. If necessary, we can update the docs to explain what happens with non aligned strides and how to handle it on the user side.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] Ready for review again!",

                "description": "# Changes\r\n\r\n- This PR adds \"serialize\" and \"parse\" functions to the flow graph, which work similarly to the other serialization functions we have in the framework\r\n- It also standardizes the construction of the blocks, with a generic construction parameters interface (which has a name for all blocks), and a generic \"configure\" function that configures blocks according to its construction parameters. This is used, for example, in the \"multiGate\" block to configure how many outputs the block has.\r\n- It also adds a getClassName function for all blocks (and I'm very sorry for the size the PR ended up with 😢 )\r\n- It also adds all the blocks to the class register\r\n- Removed the CustomFunctionBlock since it's not on the spec and I was just using it for tests. Instead now I'm using the Log block and mocking the console.log function\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n- Serialize: #KSTQJU#3\r\n- Parse: #CVDC94#2",

                "description": "I've added `Mesh.renderWithRenderPassId` to make it easier to render an entire mesh without having to loop through sub-meshes by hand. If you provide a render pass ID, this is a useful method for rendering a mesh multiple times in a frame.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I used to reply to forum posts, when a specific rendering effect required a mesh to be rendered multiple times per frame, that the mesh needed to be cloned. In fact, using render pass IDs solves the problem neatly: simply create a new render pass ID and use it to assign the material you want to use to render your mesh a second time! The helper method simplifies this scheme by allowing you to perform the additional rendering in a single call.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n* Mesh cloning: https://playground.babylonjs.com/#QDAZ80#207\r\n* Use of a render pass id + helper method: https://playground.babylonjs.com/#QDAZ80#506\r\n\r\nI'd have preferred to call it `render`, but this method already exists (and draws a sub-mesh)...\r\n\r\nThis PR also makes a small change to `Tools.FloatRound`. I've checked that `Math.fround` is supported by all the browsers we're targeting (it wasn't supported by IE11 only, for which we dropped support some time ago), so it's a small performance improvement to remove the `if` condition.",

Any excess beyond the container, like a plane attached the texture with one `TextBlock`,  will not be displayed.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, when I set the `fontSize`, `width` and `resizeToFit` simultaneously, it's `width` to fit `fontSize`, rather `fontSize` to fit `width`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet text = new BABYLON.GUI.TextBlock();\r\ntext.text = \"Hello world\";\r\ntext.fontSize = 50;\r\ntext.width = 0.5\r\ntext.resizeToFit = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n**It's all about the content.** There's nothing about the `container` or `to fit container`.\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, the original version is kind of ambiguous to understand.

The part that is missing to ultimately solve this is some sort of function or BaseTexture-property that can tell whether the texture uses a GPU compressed format.

This is because, if we have the same graph running with multiple contexts, the value of a data connection can be different between them. I wasn't differentiating them before, which was an oversight.\r\n\r\n- When a block executes, it now knows which of its input signals activated the block. This is needed for blocks that have a \"reset\" input, such as some of the conditional blocks added.\r\n\r\n# Example PGs\r\n \r\n- #RKQX23#10: DoN - Click on the sphere to log a message max 5 times, click on the box to reset the DoN counter\r\n- #BWRXG9#2: Throttle - Log a message every 3 seconds using onTick event and Throttle, click on the sphere to reset the throttle\r\n- #RKQX23#7: Multigate - without looping, click on the sphere to log the number of execution\r\n- #RKQX23#8: Multigate - with looping, click on the sphere to log the number of execution\r\n- #RKQX23#9: Multigate - with looping and randomizing, click on the sphere to log the number of execution\r\n- #RKQX23#6: Switch - Change the switch's value on the code\r\n- #J1N2GP#5: Wait all - Click on the 3 spheres to open the door, click on the box to reset the wait all count\r\n- #9C7VK6#1: Counter - Log the value on the counter after a delay, explore the value in two different contexts \r\n- #5JFH79#7: While loop - Logs from 1 to 5",

For now, adding this flag to read from the glTF accessor instead and log a warning when there is a mismatch.",

The old function decodes to `VertexData` which requires floats. This is slow if the Draco data has non-float data.\r\n- Update `VertexBuffer` class to allow passing null to engine to support scenarios where the buffer is just being used for manipulating data. This is used in the old `decodeMeshAsync` to convert the non-float data to float data.\r\n- Update `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` loader to use new `decodeMeshToGeometryAsync`.\r\n- Update Draco dist to official 1.5.6 (this isn't required but might as well) and remove instructions to build a custom IE version as we don't support IE anymore.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the assets from #11685 are not proper. As [noted](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/issues/11685#issuecomment-1000350051) by @Popov72, the Draco decoder decodes the data with normalized being false when it is supposed to be true. It only works in three.js because it uses the information from glTF. We shouldn't rely on glTF information as Draco data is supposed to be self-contained. The mannequin asset from the forum correctly decodes with normalized being true.",

To centralize the listening and notifying of events, a new class was added, named FlowGraphEventCoordinator. Multiple Flow Graphs can share the same Event Coordinator and with that, communicate with each other through events. \r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n#J1N2GP#1 -> click on the sphere, the door opening animation will play\r\n#GPPEUA#5 -> click on the green button, the animation plays. Click on the red button, the animation stops.\r\n#MD0K3B -> click on the button, the two spheres will move up\r\n\r\nOn the three cases, the button and the acted upon object have distinct graphs, and communicate through a custom event.",

                "description": "## Changes:\r\n- Added the idea of a \"context\" of a graph, that is created by `graph.createContext`, and is used for both user variables , block-scoped execution variables (such as the current index of a for loop block), graph-scoped execution variables (such as the scene the graph runs in), and also to keep a list of blocks with pending tasks. When blocks execute, they pass the context down to the next block.\r\n- GetVariable and SetVariable blocks\r\n- Conditional data and conditional execution block. The former returns a value depending on a condition and the latter executes a flow depending on a condition.\r\n- PlayAnimation Block \r\n- SetProperty Block\r\n- Timer Block, it can execute an action immediately and another action after a delay\r\n- Data connection points now receive a RichType instead of a default value. A RichType follows an interface containing the name of the type (which can be useful for displaying different colors depending of type on the visual tool), and a function to generate a default value of the type. \r\n- A connection point is now able to connect to multiple other points depending on its type, as follows:\r\n    - Data output blocks can connect to MULTIPLE points, since a piece of data can be used by many blocks.\r\n    - Data input blocks can only connect to ONE point, because a block has to have a well defined source of data.\r\n    - Signal output blocks can only connect to ONE point, because a block can only execute one well defined flow after it.\r\n    - Signal input blocks can connect to MULTIPLE points, since the same flow can be executed from multiple antecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example PGs:\r\n- #43USDV#4 -> once the scene starts, runs a for loop and log its index \r\n- #43USDV#3 -> click on the sphere or on the cube, it will run a for loop and log its index \r\n- #GQAXFL#7 -> click on the sphere or on the cube, it will immediately change color to red, and 1s later change color to yellow\r\n- #GQAXFL#5 -> click on the sphere or on the cube and each will run a different animation. you can press \"p\" to dispose of the graph",

Now this scenario is checked, and if it occurs, we skip rendering that tree. This avoids empty divs on the twin tree.",

This causes all subsequent calls to `AudioEngine._triggerRunningState()` to early out making it impossible to resume the audio context again.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes the issue by checking the `_tryToRun` flag. If it is `true` then the audio context is suspended and the `_tryToRun` flag is reset to `false` before attempting to resume the audio context.\r\n\r\nReported on forum: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/unmute-icon-remove/257/25\r\n\r\nTested on iOS using playground https://playground.babylonjs.com/#35VF39#3",

It's a set of `strings` instead of `TransformNode` / `Bone` / ... so that a single mask can be used for several animation groups.\r\n\r\nBy way of illustration, in the Avatar PoC, I can remove the custom functions `RemoveIdentityTransformationsFromAnimationGroup` and `RemoveTargetsFromAnimationGroup` and replace them with something like :\r\n```typescript\r\nconst animationGroupMask = new BABYLON.AnimationGroupMask([<list of bone names used by the facial animation>]);\r\n\r\nthis._facialAnimationGroup.mask = animationGroupMask;\r\nthis._facialAnimationGroup.removeUnmaskedAnimations();\r\n```\r\nThere's no hurry to review the PR, so don't bother if you're on vacation!",

The plugin no longer stores the options object, and instead unwraps each property of option into its own direct plugin property.\r\n\r\nIt also means I can remove the serialize/parse methods, applying the serialization decorator to each property instead.\r\n\r\n(I did look into making a new decorator for custom objects, but I don't know enough about TS metaprogramming to make it in time!)",

Ultimately it produces a geometry but with a procedural approach\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n- The cost of downloading assets on the web is a strong limiting factor and procedural data can help solve that by limiting the download to the core pieces that are assembled later on by the NodeGeometry system (Example PG: #PYY6XE#59)\r\n- The system is dynamic and can produce an infinity of variants. Far above what an offline source can produce (think about terrain generation or vegetation generation).\r\n- It allows a new way of modelling by assembling core shapes and playing around with a node system",

This ensures that the engine would only match complete words, not substrings within longer words or comments.\r\n\r\nThe regular expressions have been updated as follows: \r\n````\r\nconst outRegex = /(flat\\s)?\\s*\\bout\\b /;\r\nconst inRegex = /(flat\\s)?\\s*\\bin\\b /;\r\nconst varyingRegex = /(flat\\s)?\\s*\\bvarying\\b/ ;\r\n````\r\n\r\n",

                "description": "Hello first let me explain the bug I found.\r\n\r\n- The `Bone.returnToRest()` method performs `this._matrix = this._restMatrix;` when there is no `_linkedTransformNode`.\r\nhttps://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/packages/dev/core/src/Bones/bone.ts#L322\r\n\r\n- And the 'rest matrix' is compared to the 'local matrix', and if the two are the same, the matrix update is canceled.\r\nhttps://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/packages/dev/core/src/Bones/bone.ts#L70-L80\r\n\r\nHowever, if the local matrix needs to be composed (which means the local matrix is out of date), comparing the local matrix with the pose matrix is problematic.\r\n\r\nHere's the specific code that causes the bug.\r\n```typescript\r\n// First, call returnToRest to make the localMatrix and restMetrix the same.\r\nbone.returnToRest();\r\n\r\n// then executes code that can replace the values of _localPosition, _localRotation, or _localScaling.\r\n// The local matrix is now out of date and requires a compose.\r\nbone.setPosition(new Vector3(1, 2, 3), Space.LOCAL);\r\n\r\n// Then the _localPosition_ has changed, but the localMatrix and restMatrix are still the same,\r\n// so this code does not work properly.\r\nbone.returnToRest();\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, you can check the equality comparison with _needToCompose. (May not be the best way)\r\nSo this is what the modified code looks like this:\r\n```typescript\r\nset _matrix(value: Matrix) {\r\n    // skip if the matrices are the same\r\n    if (value.updateFlag === this._localMatrix.updateFlag && !this._needToCompose) {\r\n        this._needToCompose = false; // in case there was a pending compose\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    this._needToCompose = false; // in case there was a pending compose\r\n\r\n    this._localMatrix.copyFrom(value);\r\n    this._markAsDirtyAndDecompose();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe method `Bone.updateMatrix` also has the same problem because it uses the `_matrix` property.\r\n\r\nI would like to mention someone who I think would be knowledgeable about this issue. If I mention someone incorrectly, I apologize in advance.\r\n@Popov72 ",

                "description": "Allows MESH and CONVEX_HULL shapes to be constructed from TransformNode or InstancedMesh instances and  correctly account for transform of children when includeChildMeshes is set to true.\r\n\r\nDiscussed this with @carolhmj - there were a couple of failure cases or unexpected behaviour when building physics shapes.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of one of the failure cases (check the console logs): https://playground.babylonjs.com/#5BJIYA#3 - this loads a glTF file which contains a mesh with multiple materials. The loader will create a single TransformNode with two Mesh children - one for each material.  If a user tries to build a physics shape from the \"Cube\" object (which is a glTF mesh, but a Babylon TransformNode) they'll hit the failure cases in the console.log()s. Similarly, if the mesh was instanced multiple times, the old code previously tried to use an `InstancedMesh` instance as if it were a `Mesh`, which would raise an exception accessing an undefined property (`Mesh.getVerticesData`)\r\n\r\nThis change allows a user to create a single physics shape from this scene construct. I've also tested this with some additional playground scenes, which @carolhmj linked me to:\r\n\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#5BJIYA#4\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#K7TJIG#363\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#9T64J6\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#R9DTZ0#16\r\n\r\nAnd made a new variant of one, which tests this includeChildMeshes functionality in the complicated \"Buggy\" asset:\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#K7TJIG#371\r\n\r\nSince I can imagine that this case of constructing a single physics shape from a whole branch of the scene hierarchy is useful, it would probably also be nice to expose the includeChildMeshes property to the PhysicsShapeMesh and PhysicsShapeConvexHull constructors, without having to require users use the PhysicsShape base class.",

                "description": "A user in the forum found an issue where having an active SpriteManager was interfering with picking being done when `scene.constantlyUpdateMeshUnderPointer` is set to true.  This PR makes two small changes.  First, because of how the SpriteManager works, lazy picking cannot be applied so if there's an active SpriteManager, lazy picking isn't used.  Second, if the `scene.constantlyUpdateMeshUnderPointer` is set to true, lazy picking will also be disabled as the mesh under the pointer will not be updated normally until the property is accessed.\r\n\r\nA test has also been added to verify that picking is done before the picking info is referenced under these specific circumstances.",

                "description": "In my scene with 50+ shaders the ShaderDefineExpression.infixToPostfix was called 15 000–35 000 times while scene is loading. In average for one loading it takes 54.28ms for all calls and 34.39ms for first 15 000 calls.\r\nAfter optimized from this PR I achieve next result: 9.68ms for all calls and 7.09ms for first 15 000 calls.\r\n\r\nI made two simple changes:\r\n1. If `infix` does not contain operators, then it will not be modified, so we can return it as is.\r\n2. As I mention above this function called thousands times while scene loading. But the input string are not unique every time, in fact, in my case, it was only 168 unique infixes. So there is a reason to use memoization, because the result of this function deterministic and has no side effects as I can see.\r\nFor safety work with memory I add a limit for memoize cache as 50000 entries. In my case the 100 entries takes 6504 chars of memory, so with the basic interpolation it might be around 640 KB for 50 000 entries. As all we know, 640K ought to be enough for anybody :)\r\n\r\nSo, just with this two changes  performance of the function was boosted 5.6x times and for my middle (as I think now) scene it saves 45ms (or almost 3 frames) for loading.",

                "description": "I have a pretty big scene (100+ meshed, 50+ shaders) in glb format, when it loaded the loop in the `ShaderProcessor._ProcessIncludes()` was called 4927 times, and takes 200.57 ms and each loop take 0.0407ms. This values bases on 30 runs.\r\nAfter performance optimzations I got next result — the loop calls 3955 times, takes 70.82ms for all calls and 0.0179ms per one loop.\r\n\r\n1. I make regex as a static fields to avoid builing it in runtime.\r\n2. Change string replaces from regex to regular string where it possible.\r\n3. Replace while loop to for-of to avoid uneccessary `.exec()` at end of while-loop.\r\n4. Replace very heavy string replace opertation to `parts.join(\"\")` (more then 2x boost here)\r\n5. Fix warning from `new String()`.\r\n\r\nEvery change puts in a single commit.\r\n\r\nFor future discussing - we also can change this part:\r\n```ts\r\nfor (let index = 0; index < splits.length; index += 2) {\r\n    const source = new RegExp(splits[index], \"g\");\r\n    const dest = splits[index + 1];\r\n    includeContent = includeContent.replace(source, dest);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith `.replaceAll` and save 5-7ms for all loading time (it would be 65ms for all calls in my case). But now I can't use it because `TS2550: Property 'replaceAll' does not exist on type 'string'. Do you need to change your target library? Try changing the 'lib' compiler option to 'es2021' or later.`",

This PR allows that the target position can also be set to the pivot point of the attached node (If it is an instance of `TransformNode`). This mainly increases the usability of the `RotationGizmo` since it will stay in place during the rotation if a custom pivot point was defined.\r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\nI tested it for all Gizmos (position, rotation, scale, boundingBox) with different settings (`updateScale`, `updateGizmoPositionToMatchAttachedMesh`, custom mesh pivot). The only thing I noticed is that `BoundingBoxGizmo` does not work probably with a custom pivot point.

Avoid regex test, when it need with simple condition with `indexOf(\"#\")`.\r\n\r\nWhy I made it. I has a pretty big scene, where by my performance tracker to the `_MoveCursor` was detected 51475 call times.\r\nI had 16 measurements and it takes from 31 to 58 ms for my scene for all calls, and 44.73ms for all measurements in average.\r\n\r\nThen I tried to move regex into static field, then I had 13 runs of my measurement tool and now `_MoveCursor` takes 40.74ms in average for same 51475 calls.\r\n\r\nThen I add condition with `indexOf(\"#\")` and for 18 runs the `_MoveCursor` takes 28.67ms in average.\r\n\r\nOne improtant moment: I don't now how to test this changes. I see that ShaderProcessor does not have own test file. Maybe it possible to test with screenshot tests, but how it runs now?\r\n\r\nP. S.

In this case, the defined width and height will be taken as the new width and height.

Can it be removed, adjusted higher or an additional option added to ignore it?\r\n\r\nWith the current 4096 max value limit in place it is impossible to use any proper \"out door\" unclipped HDRI images without having incorrect lighting.\r\n\r\nFor example an extremely bright outdoor HDRI here (https://polyhaven.com/a/rustig_koppie) has peak brightness of over 300.000 for pixels directly in the center of the sun.\r\n\r\nA Playground example shows how the current limit incorrectly produces extremely dim lighting: https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#6CJSXS#2\r\n\r\nWith 4096 limit in place:\r\n![bright-hdr-sh-with-limit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1881360/235967809-4f45bc7f-74d5-47c3-82ce-77c38bda668e.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes removing the limit, in which case the calculated spherical harmonics produces correctly bright lighting even for bright outdoor HDRIs:\r\n![bright-hdr-sh-no-limit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1881360/235968047-f42d609a-8712-4e99-b12a-8379b792f6a7.jpg)\r\n",

This made the RTT render on a quarter of the screen (instead of half of the screen, as expected in XR with two eyes).\nThis changes RTT rendering in Rigged cameras (which ATM is mainly WebXR). It is expected that tha parent's camera will be the full viewport to render both eyes (which is 100% viewport in case of XR).\n\nIt is a small breaking change, but is actually more a bug fix.",

                "description": "This pull request combines feature requests of two forum threads from last year:\r\n\r\n- https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/node-pbr-material-renders-black-if-mesh-doesnt-have-normals/29011\r\n- https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/default-nodematerial-vertex-color-input-to-white-if-attribute-doesnt-exist-on-mesh/29461\r\n\r\nI recently refactored a project where I used custom blocks to work around those issues above, and ended up with a single `MeshAttributeFallbackBlock` that I think might be flexible enough to be added to Babylon.js itself.\r\n\r\nThe nodeblock itself is pretty simple. It allows connecting to an attribute input (or morph target block) and has another falback input to provide value if mesh doesn't have the said attribute.\r\n\r\nHere is a test NME url (only works with these PR changes in place): `/#W3ZANW` and a Playground test url: `/#5LCPMS`\r\n\r\nThe above example demonstrates three use cases where such node is useful / necessary:\r\n\r\n### Vertex color fallback\r\n\r\nThis allows using same NodeMaterial with meshes or mesh primitives that contain and don't contain vertex colors. Currently if vertex color is used, it defaults to black color when attribute is present and there is no way to distinguish between actually intented black color and missing attribute.\r\n\r\n![Vertex Color Fallback](https://static.miikah.fi/other/images/nme_vertex_color_fallback.png)\r\n\r\n### Normal fallback\r\n\r\nIt is possible to generate flat normal in fragment shader if attribute isn't present. This matches gltf spec where a flat normal is used for meshes that don't contain normals.\r\n\r\n![Normal Fallback](https://static.miikah.fi/other/images/nme_normal_fallback.png)\r\n\r\n### UV fallback\r\n\r\nAnd kind of as additional possibility that my original normal and vertex color specific nodes didn't allow, is generating UV fallback with a generated UV if attribute isn't present.\r\n\r\n![UV Fallback](https://static.miikah.fi/other/images/nme_generated_uv_fallback.png)",

The user must now prefix all inputs/outputs with the correct object (`vertexInputs`/`vertexOutputs`/`fragmentInputs`/`fragmentOutputs`). This is a breaking change but it's the only way to make it work with WebGPU, and WebGPU isn't out yet so it doesn't matter much.\r\n* Updated caps based on actual limits retrieved from the device.\r\n* Uniformity analysis (UA) fixed. I did not disable uniformity analysis as a whole (`WebGPUTintWASM.DisableUniformityAnalysis = false`), let's see if we get any feedback from users because of the failure of uniformity analysis (all visual tests are successful).\r\n* there are still two visualization tests that fail (\"Shadows CSM and LODs\" and \"Multi shadow generators per light\") because of https://bugs.chromium.org/p/tint/issues/detail?id=1886\r\n* several fixes (wrong depth/stencil texture format in MultiRenderTarget in some cases, memory leaks, etc.)\r\n\r\nFixes #13633, #13564",

                "description": "A user in the forum found an issue where they were starting and stopping a pointerlock during a drag motion.  At the end of their movement, it was found that there was a strange rotation made in an unintended angle.  It was determined that `isPointerLock` wasn't being updated during the first move to occur after the lock was released.  The `pointerlockchange` event was being fired after the move was being handled so the camera input thought that a pointerlock was actinve and moved accordingly.  This PR will change the behavior of isPointerLock to check and update isPointerLock during a `pointermove` event when a pointerlock is active.\r\n\r\nForum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/camera-does-a-strange-rotation-on-cursor-lock/37904",

Upon closer inspection, it was determined that the WheelEvent was being given an erroneous pointerId, causing two different meshes under pointers to be stored.  This PR will fix the logic and remove the offending check from the InputManager to make it more platform-agnostic.\r\n\r\nFor Safari, all mouse pointerIds will be set to 1, if undefined.  This is because 1 is the current pointerId recognized when a pointercapture is active.  The pointercapture test for Safari has been updated to properly check this.\r\n\r\nForum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/triggering-pointer-out-actions-when-camera-change-causes-pointer-to-exit-mesh/39061",

                "description": "### Summary\r\nThis fix massively improves SSAO2 when using low sample counts, like the default 8.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nIt was discovered as part of PR #13621 but is submitted as a new PR since 13621 is now all about adding control over the SSAO2 denoiser without changing anything by default.\r\n\r\nThis small change however is so massively positive in all the tests I have done that it shouldn't be left out by default but be considered a bugfix.\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nThe fix is rather simple. When calculating if sample X is occluded by sample Y in the SSAO2 calculations we considered everything with a depth difference of 0 (zero) to mean Y occludes X. However, this does not take any calculation or precision errors into account, which causes samples along a \"flat\" surface to occlude each other. Basically, the flat surface was occluding itself...\r\n\r\nThis fix adds an epsilon of sorts to the calculation. The value 0.02 was selected from testing and gave the best improvements on all tests I did and at the same time practically left the 16-sample case untouched.\r\n\r\nThat said, on hardware that doesn't have the same precision in the shaders. might benefit from a higher threshold, as would some scenes like the kitchen example. But going over 0.02 starts to affect samples >=16 which isn't great from a backward compatibility standpoint.\r\n\r\nI did not make this into a tunable setting, since I don't expect that a user of Babylon.js would understand how it affects the shader calculations. This should just work.\r\n\r\n### Test results\r\nIn the screenshots below, the \"8x\" part denotes how many SSAO2 samples were used, old version is on the left and the new one is on the right.\r\n\r\nNotice how the fixed version is pretty similar to the 16x reference when the sample count goes down. But the old version goes bananas with incorrect occlusions everywhere. Also note that the two versions at sample count 16 are basically identical.\r\n\r\nThe images were saved without the blur-stage of the SSAO2 filter active, to better show the SSAO2 calculations.\r\n\r\n#### Terrain (#N96NXC#127)\r\n#### 16x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774831-d85b9050-f1a5-403f-b6e1-61c529454576.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774837-3371b66a-8158-41f7-9493-54516b75bfe0.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 12x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774821-04e478ad-0486-4ce0-88f3-146cc7ac9f03.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774826-deb8ec49-c573-4166-b68c-de79fd5faa61.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 8x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774799-e9c31bac-3701-42e3-b7ac-787d005ca85b.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774815-c77ae725-930e-4bb3-ac6e-3b1ea2669862.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n##### 4x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774770-2c835b0b-c975-49d6-a2f4-c72c59e6e2bf.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774781-d8046245-0d5a-43e8-959a-b79192d560de.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### Cat (#T3K2SA#1)\r\n#### 16x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775114-4eab9d30-243c-445c-a9db-69cafb4517a0.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775121-f5b54df1-141d-4831-8009-1f3e2aee28bb.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 12x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775087-7ef5ae1e-e915-4390-812f-aa0a41782c78.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775098-6b8ffcfb-b956-467b-b155-aa106f895384.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 8x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775071-8d1056be-688b-4026-b31c-807259ae2464.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775079-5fd547b9-0daf-43b6-a522-d04ebef5e986.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 4x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775032-6614547a-cad3-4077-90f2-17bcbfc34af0.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775055-e2c308b5-40e6-4979-928d-92f59f63b055.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n\r\n### Room (#LCUPCU#14)\r\n#### 16x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775203-f00eba22-9625-43e4-8a00-cd200fb2290d.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775212-ecc1247d-c586-49a6-a7f7-d1ddf87eebe5.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 12x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775185-70b1209f-f7d3-48f6-af15-4c0c31c0a733.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775193-69fd1987-2ed4-41e2-9c62-6947fc1c2868.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 8x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775164-10d8d6fa-8717-470f-9196-cf6c6312735d.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775175-3cc2ca52-6de8-4ec2-b085-e93f8c9b4ab0.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 4x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775145-d4bee5a3-56e4-458d-b4f0-e8a5940f22ac.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775153-79bf0883-3a7b-4c54-bc70-9863eae0eaff.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n",

A class that let's you generate decals in a texture with `MeshUVSpaceRenderer.renderTexture(texture, position, normal, size, angle)`. The texture creation and the rendering of the decal is handled by the class.\r\n  * Assign a `MeshUVSpaceRenderer` instance to `mesh.decalMap` to enable the feature for the mesh\r\n* Material side:\r\n  * `DecalMapConfiguration`. A material plugin, implemented much like `DetailMapConfiguration` for the detail map feature.\r\n  * Enable the decal map rendering with `material.decalMap.isEnabled = true`.\r\n  * This class will automatically bind the texture from `mesh.decalMap`, which means a single material with decal map enabled can be used for multiple meshes, one does not have to create a material instance per mesh that needs to support decal map.\r\n\r\nTest PG: http://localhost:1338/#9BVW2S#48\r\n\r\nI will also update the docs.",

                "description": "This is done to avoid the pattern of adding an observer after checking if the state requires that.\nAs an example let's take the scene's onReadyObservable which has a simple state - it will only notify once when the scene is ready. If a new observer will be added after the observable was triggered (and has notified existing observers) it will not be possible to trigger new observers that were added to is.\nIf `notifyIfTriggered` is set to true and the observable has already triggered it will automatically trigger newly added observers whenever they are added.\n\nIt's also recommended to add that to onDispose observables, which are the same.\nA different solution would be to define an onObserverAdded function, but that would require setting this function to every observable that requires it. Instead - this is a more generic solution.",

The reason for this is that by default, the capabilities of e.g. Safari include ASTC, so the ASTC transcoder is selected even without the default options, e.g.:\r\n```js\r\n> console.log(gl.getExtension('WEBGL_compressed_texture_astc'))\r\n[Log] WebGLCompressedTextureASTC {getSupportedProfiles: function, COMPRESSED_RGBA_ASTC_4x4_KHR: 37808, COMPRESSED_RGBA_ASTC_5x4_KHR: 37809, COMPRESSED_RGBA_ASTC_5x5_KHR: 37810, COMPRESSED_RGBA_ASTC_6x5_KHR: 37811, …}\r\n```\r\nBut in Chrome, for example, this extension does not exist (that's weird, no?), so the caps of the engine do not have `astc` set:\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log(gl.getExtension('WEBGL_compressed_texture_astc'));\r\nnull\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis resolves my issue, but I'm not familiar with the inner workings of this subsystem and the potential other implications of these changes, so I would like to ask for comments & feedback. Thank you!",

                "description": "A user on the forums had recently found an issue when performing input while using an on-demand rendering loop.  The issue was that the `onViewMatrixChangedObservable` wasn't firing as a part of pointer input.  This behavior was present in previous versions.  It was determined that the Lazy Picking changes may have caused this change because the aforementioned observable only fires during `getViewMatrix()` calls.  Before the Lazy Picking implementation, this function was called as a part of the creation and assignment of the picking ray for a PickingInfo object.  Since this ray is only created when picking happens, a pointer event that doesn't require picking info won't ever get to the point where `getViewMatrix` is called.  Technically, these get functions should be called as a part of the camera's update function so the fix is to do just that.\r\n\r\nTests have been added to verify that `onViewMatrixObservable` and `onProjectionMatrixObservable` are firing properly.\r\n\r\nForum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/on-demand-rendering-solution-broken-since-5-29/36379/1\r\nIssue Link: https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/issues/13551",

                "description": "My last PR: #13513 introduced logic to refresh the VideoTexture's internal texture when the underlying video changed sizes.\r\n\r\nI missed an edge case where the resize event can occur on the same frame that the texture was already updated from. When that happens the new texture was not getting hooked up to the video feed because of a no-op condition that avoids updating the texture twice in one frame. This change ensures that when swapping out the internal texture it also gets re-registered with the video feed.",

                "description": "This PR updates VideoTexture to listen for the [VideoElement resize event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLVideoElement/videoHeight#examples) and resize the texture to match. For a URL video the scenario would not be common, but when creating a video from a camera stream you can use the media constraints to change the resolution/aspect ratio on the fly. Another camera example is when on mobile and you rotate the phone the video stream also resizes from portrait to landscape orientation.\r\n\r\nI created this Playground example to demonstrate the current issue (and to test my PR changes):\r\n[https://playground.babylonjs.com/#4W5WYX](https://playground.babylonjs.com/#4W5WYX)\r\n\r\nIn the playground app the camera's aspect ratio is updated ever 3 seconds to go between 16:9 and 1:1 aspect ratios. Without these changes the video just gets squashed when the aspect ratio changes, additionally if the end user tried to readPixels from the texture they would not get the full image due to a missmatch between the internal texture and the actual video frames.\r\n\r\nWith these changes the plane that the VideoTexture is placed on is able to respond to the change in aspect ratio so the video does not become distorted. Additionally readPixels is able to pull the full frame of the camera and match the native video resolution.\r\n\r\nThis issue is mentioned in the BabylonNative repo here:\r\n[https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/issues/1107](https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/issues/1107)\r\n",

If the sound stops on its own when reaching the end of the sound source, the start time and current time are not reset. This causes the `currentTime` property to report the wrong time when the sound is restarted after stopping on its own, and then being paused.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes the issue by resetting the start time and current time when the sound source ends on its own.\r\n\r\nReported on forum here: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/sound-currenttime-exceeds-total-duration-in-some-cases/37668",

The options defined in this way have priority over those passed when creating a KTX2 texture with `new Texture(...)`. This way you can easily force certain behaviors for the decoder without altering the way KTX2 textures are created.\r\n\r\nTo resolve the issue raised in the forum thread linked above, proceed as follows:\r\n```javascript\r\nBABYLON.KhronosTextureContainer2.DefaultKTX2DecoderOptions.useRGBAIfOnlyBC1BC3AvailableWhenUASTC = true;\r\n```\r\nwhich will force the use of uncompressed RGBA if only BC1 and BC3 are available as compressed formats.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] Note that `useRGBAIfOnlyBC1BC3AvailableWhenUASTC = true` is the default, for performance reason (see comments in code) [/EDIT]\r\n\r\nNote that `ktx2decoderTypes.ts` is defined in the core and not in the **ktx2Decoder** package to avoid an external dependency for the core and I'm not sure that `Materials/Textures/` is the best location for this file...",

This is confusing.

I just make some 2 files more consistent where we used to use a mix of both, and I updated the `ThinEngine.QueueNewFrame` to NOT call `window.setTimeout`, but to fall back on the global `setTimeout`.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo really be \"environment  independant\", we should never call a function that is \"environment  dependant\" directly, and put them all behind a configurable callback registry. This registry would be initialized with default values, and could be customizes by the user depending on its needs. But I'm not sure how it is doable, and anyway that's another story :)\r\n",

In order to achieve that, there're a few changes I need to make:\r\n\r\n1. Change the visibility of `_dragPlane` field from private to protected to allow more customization in the inherited class.\r\n2. Force calling `releaseDrag` if the start dragging failed to prevent the freezing (not be able to drag) due to how the dragging state is handled\r\n3. Pass the information of the active pointer in the drag observables in addition to the `pointerId`, this is to let the user have  access to more information about the pointer and it especially useful when detecting the type of the event (e.g. click, touch)",

                "description": "IMO, this added note in the installation documentation can clear possible confusion between using 'babylonjs' and using its '@babylonjs/core' counterpart.\r\n\r\nAn example for this possible confusion can be seen in [this](https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/difference-between-babylonjs-and-babylonjs-npm-packages/28380/4) forum question.\r\n\r\nI think the reason this can be confusing is that some NPM packages use a none-scoped package such as 'package-name' that uses a scoped package ('@scope/package-name') behind the scenes. With `Babylon.js`, this is not the case, you can use one or the other, the original package or its ES6 counterpart, not both.\r\n\r\nThis note clears this up. \r\n\r\nPerhaps even add a complete section to emphasis the ES6 version installation process? Will the ES6 version be the recommended go-to version in the near future?",

Then, it periodically executes the opposite operation, cloning the editor controllers and adding them to the live scene.  ",

Shared things are in `physics/`\r\n- v1 and v2 have different names (body/shape/material/constraint in V2 and impostor/joint in V1) and different concepts\r\n- Have an helper `PhysicsAggregate` that will contain a body, a material and a shape that can be created by 1 call (just like existing v1)\r\n\r\nOn the Babylon side, Material, shape, body are opaque proxies. Real work is done in the plugin. Plugin stores its references thanks to `public _pluginData: any = undefined;`\r\n\r\nPhysicsViewer, mesh,....still using v1.\r\n\r\nTested with PG from documentation and PhysicsDebug Viewer.\r\n",

However, it's not a small task and I'm not a React expert, so I have not done it as part of this PR.\r\n\r\nIf we don't want to reference the LiLGUI package from `FluidRenderingGUI`, maybe I should remove the class and add it in the documentation for users as a debugging tool?\r\n\r\nCloses #13087 ",

                "description": "A user on the forums recently found an issue related to `onPointerObservable` where skipNextObservers weren't working as they used to.  This issue was a side effect of an optimization make in support of Lazy Picking.  This optimization would take all internal camera inputs and remove them from the user-facing `onPointerObservable`.  This would cause the camera input observers to be inaccessible in the same way.  This PR will add them back to `onPointerObservable` but keep track of how many camera input observers have been added and require either user-defined observer as part of the criteria for picking.\r\n\r\nForum Post: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/no-longer-able-to-cancel-camera-inputs-with-new-oncamerainputobservable/35793",

In the PG demo below, we have implemented a very basic one with a `CustomBlock`.\r\n\r\nHere is a PG that uses all these new features:\r\n\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#M3QR7E#34\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4152247/203122324-d3f20b41-c7c5-40b9-96ab-b0baa03da9ca.png)\r\n",

Baking texture transform is not actually a valid solution when texture transform cannot fit the `KHR_texture_transform` extension.\r\n3. Exporting textures go through an unnecessary step of encoding from array buffer to base64 and then back. This is dumb.\r\n4. Code was a mess. Some weird async constructs and code duplication.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Log a warning instead of baking the texture when the texture transform isn't center at the origin.\r\n- Rewrite a chunk of the material export code to de-dupe textures based on whether the texture points to the same internal texture (and mime type).\r\n- Factor the code.",

The problem is that the cascaded shadow generator (CSG) generates the shadow map depending on a camera position/rotation. So, a CSG is only valid for a light + a camera: if rendering with another camera, the CSG for this light is invalid.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for multiple shadow generators per light: an additional `camera` parameter can be passed to the shadow generator constructor. By default, `camera=null` and the code is backward compatible: when you retrieve a shadow generator, you get the one for the null camera.\r\n\r\nFix #12716.\r\n\r\nHere's a fixed PG:\r\n\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#11BH6Z#947",

I've run \"npm run test:unit\" and \"npm run build:dev\" in GitPod, both were OK. The one-line change fixed the bug in my local repro.\r\n\r\nDetails of the bug (copied from the forum post):\r\n\r\n1. Add two meshes to a scene, add both to the glow layer, set both to use their own material (referenceMeshToUseItsOwnMaterial).\r\n2. Make the meshes partially transparent.\r\n3. Move the camera so it is looking through transparent parts of one mesh to see the other.\r\n4. The far-away mesh will lose its glow effect when seen through the transparent parts of the close mesh.\r\n\r\nDemo: https://playground.babylonjs.com/#SRZRWV#1139\r\n(Move the camera so that you are looking at parts of one glowing ball through the transparent parts of another ball. Observe that the parts of the far-away ball seen through the close-up ball do not glow.)",

                "description": "Recently, there was a bug fix put out that addressed an issue where a POINTERTAP event was occurring if the cursor happened to return to the same position after moving outside of the tap range.  Unfortunately, there was a missed scenario where the swipe state wasn't being properly reset if we skipped the next observable call (like when clicking on a UI element).  This PR adds a check to make sure that we reset the swipe state if we are skipping said call.  \r\n\r\nRelated Forum Post: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/first-pointerpick-event-is-not-emitted-immediately-after-interacting-with-gui-control-that-is-a-pointerblocker/35008",

I ended up refactoring/simplifying most of the KHR_animation_pointer code, but the overall idea is still the same.\r\n\r\n- Fix the code such that it will call animation loading extension functions again. This is the main thing that was broken.\r\n- Update the contract for loading animations to support custom extensions to be more flexible without override arguments (e.g., `animationTargetOverride`).\r\n- Break up the animation pointer map into core and extensions to avoid core loader depending on code from an extension.\r\n- Greatly simplify parsing of animation pointers.",

The property of PointsCloudSystem `mesh` has incorrect type. In fact this property may have `undefined` as value, because it's not defined in the constructor. So I add optional mark `?` to type and required checks in the class.\r\n2. And after this I found what the `intersectsMesh` function did not check the mesh property existing in the point cloud system. So I add a new Error here, that notice about required mesh to next calculations.\r\n3. The line `isSphere = isSphere ? isSphere : false;` look like redundant, because TypeScript promise that it have boolean type.\r\n4. Next I move the getBoundingInfo call into one line `const bbox = target.getBoundingInfo().boundingBox;`. It's look for me as potential performance boost, maybe.\r\n5. And at the end I remove `else` branch because it rendundant because the code above have return statements.\r\n\r\nAnd I limited test cases from 729 possible combinations to 126, they seems like corner cases for me. I dont know which cases we can reduce to save the working guarantee.",

                "description": "I ran into a situation where I wanted to use the sound engine in Babylon to play my pre-generated Web Audio Buffer. I managed to get it to work by looking at the code, but I had to access some private properties. I noticed that it would be pretty small refactoring to implement it correctly since the code was already there. This PR enable the passing of an AudioBuffer to the constructor of BABYLON.Sound.\r\n\r\nThis (very simplified) example shows how it is used:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar createScene = function () {\r\n\r\n    var scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine);\r\n    const camera = new BABYLON.ArcRotateCamera(\"Camera\", -Math.PI / 2, Math.PI / 4, 15, BABYLON.Vector3.Zero());\r\n    camera.attachControl(canvas, true);\r\n\r\n    // Create buffer\r\n    let sineBuffer = BABYLON.Engine.audioEngine.audioContext.createBuffer(1, 12e3, 48e3);\r\n    const hitBufferData = sineBuffer.getChannelData(0);\r\n    for (let i = 12e3; i--;) hitBufferData[i] = Math.cos(i * .04); \r\n\r\n    // Create and use the sound\r\n    this.sineSound = new BABYLON.Sound(\"sine\", sineBuffer); \r\n    this.sineSound.play();\r\n\r\n    return scene;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

During apointer move, the cached integer was not updated, so onPointerMove you wouldn't be able to check the depth to the button. onPointerDown's depth is correct, as onPointerDown is triggered when the button is defined as pressed, which is not when the sphere's center is at the end of the button, but a little before. This \"little\" before is defined by the pickRadius in near interaction (0.02 units).\n\nThis PR updated the height variable on pointer move as well, which would allow to check the distance correctly when using pointer move.",

                "description": "My apologies for the length of this comment, it is because I need advice on whether it will be part of my very limited project or a much larger undertaking by the community. As a large community undertaking it needs considering and approval by @deltakosh along with @PirateJC and @RaananW as it involves the docs even though it is on the API side and I would like to include @sebavan as he as also been very supportive and helpful to me. Please include anyone else you would like to talk to about it.\r\n\r\n**Reason Behind PR**\r\nWithin the API classes the search the playground for each property and method is at best hit and miss, so I thought that each property and method of a class should have its own playground example, which should be simple and as meaningful as possible. For my limited project, except for a few where they were trivial or I couldn't think of a good example or I forgot, I have done this for all the methods and classes of Vector3 in this PR.\r\n\r\n**Implications for a Large Community Undertaking**\r\nAn announcement about the undertaking.\r\nIf members do put in example PGs they could come in piecemeal so lots of individual PRs, unless there was somewhere else to submit them. This would require a moderator or moderators.\r\nSome rules for submitting an example PG, eg\r\n1. PGs should be simple and where possible meaningful.\r\n2. Code for the particular property or method should appear near the top of the PG\r\n        When meaningful means more complex code this can be achieved by wrapping the\r\n        a. method code in a function as in [https://playground.babylonjs.com/#R1F8YU#111](https://playground.babylonjs.com/#R1F8YU#111)\r\n         b. method code within an onBeforeRenderObservable as in [https://playground.babylonjs.com/#R1F8YU#63](https://playground.babylonjs.com/#R1F8YU#63)\r\n         c. complex code within functions as in [https://playground.babylonjs.com/#R1F8YU#106](https://playground.babylonjs.com/#R1F8YU#106)\r\n3. There should be comments at the top describing the method/property also stating the example use matching a template\r\n4. Template PGs for each class would be needed\r\n5. New or edited methods without a PG should have a PG submitted when method PR submitted\r\n\r\nI am sure there are more implications and I am happy for the rules to change. I only came up with them after doing half the methods.\r\n\r\nAlso as members of the community have their own agendas it is probably wishful thinking that enough people would get involved to get it done.\r\n\r\nIn terms of my very limited project I am happy to continue with the math.vector.ts classes, eg Vector2, Vector4, etc\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think and whether it is just my limited project or a community appeal.",

                "description": "Hello.\r\n\r\nI have been working on updating our electron app to the latest electron version (20.0.1, previously we used 17.3.1) and we had a breakage in our use of babylon.js when the scene is disposed:\r\n\r\n> TypeError: Failed to execute 'unobserve' on 'ComputePressureObserver': 1 argument required, but only 0 present.\r\n\r\nNote that not all electron applications will experience this problem. ComputePressureObserver is only exposed if you use `experimentalFeatures: true`.\r\n\r\nIt appears that electron 19 and up is using a Chromium version with an updated ComputePressureObserver API. Here is the relevant change in [the working draft](https://wicg.github.io/compute-pressure/):\r\n- https://github.com/WICG/compute-pressure/issues/21\r\n- https://github.com/WICG/compute-pressure/pull/25\r\n\r\nThe error is ignored in `observe` but not in `unobserve`. My first commit here catches the error in `unobserve`. I first tried to use `catch()` like in `observe` but it didn't work so I had to use `try { ... } catch {}`. Even though it isn't documented in the spec, `observe` is returning a promise but `unobserve` is not.\r\n\r\nThe second commit updates the use of the observer to work with electron >= 19. This disables the observer for electron < 19 (`ComputePressureObserver.supportedSources` is not defined), but I don't think many will notice since the only thing this is used for is the CPU utilization metric in the Realtime Performance Viewer.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-08-09 at 14 41 31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991151/183777526-040bc374-458b-446a-9fd6-5f26676ef13b.png)\r\n\r\nThe spec appears to have more updates than what electron supports. Doesn't look like the `samplerate` property works.\r\n\r\nI made this simple Electron Fiddle that can be used to test with: https://gist.github.com/stefansundin/4cee8e88133efb196f54f2d2a9f05155. You need to run `npm run start` to run the babylon.js server as well.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you want me to change anything! Thanks!",

It annoyed me that the `step` of the position fields was a bit low (pressing the up/down arrow keys only moved it slightly).\r\n\r\nThis PR solves that issue by using modifier keys. You can now hold `shift` to increase the step x10. Additionally, if you hold `ctrl` (`meta` on mac) as well, it will increase x100.\r\n\r\nI implemented this feature for both the `NumericInputComponent` and `FloatLineComponent` so it should work for all number input fields in the inspector.",

If I change from `private` to `protected`, eslint complains about naming convention, but I wonder whether it is worth to rename.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nprivate static _RotationGizmoFragmentShader\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll leave this as a draft for discussion for now, and meanwhile continue to test the extendability on this PR.\r\n ",

This has been tested with success with all the samples provided as part of the Khronos proposal.\r\nEven if functional, the code is still not very clean and many ehancement must be done in order to reach a certain level of quality. However, calendar issue drive us to put this onto PR rapidely.\r\n[AnimateAllTheThings.zip](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/files/9144599/AnimateAllTheThings.zip)\r\nThis can be tested with the file above, which encompass all the cases supported by the `KHR_animation_pointer`.\r\nThe main changes are located into 3 files.\r\n`GLTFLoader` has been simplified by moving all the animation related code to the `KHR_animation_pointer.ts` where the extension lies. `KHR_animation_pointer.map.ts` contains the pointer tree mapping and miscellaneous function to serve the pointer parsing and logic.\r\nAll the other change are to support indirection between GLTF entities and Babylon ones. This is subject to discussion, because not very \"clean\".\r\nMay close #12544 \r\n",

Press left button, middle button, then right button (Do not let go of any of them)\r\n3. Release them in this order while moving around a bit (Right, Left, Middle)\r\n4. Now camera movement should be locked to your cursor movement\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the DeviceSourceManager/DeviceInputSystem is still storing the correct values.  This fix removes the check from the InputManager.",

                "description": "Illustration showing left and right eyes in a HoloLens 2 running BabylonNative:\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"stereo-clear-artifacts\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4724014/180064594-238f7fc0-6b3f-4aeb-bd45-9c7e5244362b.png\">\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/issues/1087\r\n\r\nThere were two issues going on here. The first is that we needed to render the utility layer _after_ rendering to both eyes in the target scene. By rendering the utility layer scene in between eye renders, we were getting weird clearing behavior that is hard to describe. The second is that we were double-clearing our output render target textures in cases where `RenderTargetTexture.skipInitialClear = false`.\r\n\r\nBy changing the observable used in `utilityLayerRenderer` from `onAfterCameraRenderObservable` to `onAfterRenderCameraObservable`, we're making sure to render the layer only once after finishing both eyes (instead of after the left and before the right and then again after both eyes). This doesn't meaningfully change any behavior in rendering scenarios with cameras without sub-cameras.\r\n\r\nBy checking `Scene.autoClear` when clearing the camera's output render target, we avoid clearing our render targets when rendering multiple scenes that are supposed to layer onto those render targets. This means that clearing behavior when rendering a scene to a render target matches the clearing behavior when rendering that same scene to the default frame buffer. **This is a breaking change for experiences that expected the scene not to honor `autoClear = false` when rendering to a RTT, but this is not documented/expected behavior as far as I know.**\r\n\r\nWe weren't seeing this bug in any other scenario (i.e. Oculus on Web, native iOS, native Android, etc) because on all other platforms `RenderTargetTexture.skipInitialClear = true`, and so we never saw any weird clearing behavior because the RTT's were never getting cleared in the first place, which on those platforms is totally acceptable because they get automatically cleared by either the WebXR runtime or the BabylonNative XR implementation at the top of the frame.\r\n\r\n",

Somehow this WebAPI is defined in regular Babylon Native (there is no native polyfill, so is JSC/V8 providing this?), though it is unnecessary (the `src` property is unused in Babylon Native's `VideoTexture` implementation), and in React Native `window.URL.createObjectURL` is polyfilled partially and dies on this call. Avoiding this call makes `VideoTexture` work in Babylon React Native. The extra direct check for `video.isNative` in the BJS code is not great, but other code in this file already does it, so following the existing pattern.",

This had worked previously in 4.2.  Upon further investigation, it was found that the code used in the InputManager to route the input calls had omitted these buttons.  This PR will add them back into the InputManager.\r\n\r\nForum Post: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/scene-onpointerobservable-doesnt-catch-mouse4-and-mouse5-events-in-babylonjs-5/32225",

My original fixes addressed the original logic, which was incorrectly assigning the passive property, and makes the default value true.  This also includes removal of the preventDefault code from some of our cameras.\r\n\r\nThis current PR will accomplish two things.  One, it will revert the changes from 12703.  Second, it will set the default state of the passive property to false.  This should address an issue found in the forums where the original behavior would successfully allow for preventDefault but the newest one wouldn't.\r\n\r\nForum link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/camera-zoom-scrolling-the-page-introduced-in-5-13-1/32223/6",

The conversion constants and formulas are described in the Wikipedia article for sRGB: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB\r\n\r\nI opted to make this option a property passed into the engine, as it feels somewhat similar functionally to the engine option for high precision floats i.e., it affects many things (in this case, many shaders). IMO it would be odd to use the approximation in one shader and the exact formula in another. I think most of the time, you'd either want it always or never.",

                "description": "Stemming from this [prev PR](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/12643) prepareDefines is now called after PrepareDefinesForAttributes so that the plugin's defines aren't overwritten. However some of the built-in plugins rely on prepareDefines being called before PrepareDefinesForAttributes (in particular the ones that call PrepareDefinesForMergedUV which needs to be called before PrepareDefinesForAttributes).\r\n\r\nSo this PR just changes these plugins to use prepareDefinesBeforeAttributes, which is called before PrepareDefinesForAttributes to match the original behavior (this is the same fix that was created for the PBRAnisotropicConfiguration plugin in the original PR, which I thought was the only one affected).\r\n\r\nForum issue about the PBRSheenConfiguration plugin: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/texture-not-displaying-for-sheen-extension/32110",

Additionally, there are tests to verify that our skip booleans (eg. skipPointerUpPredicate) will prevent picking in scenarios where we don't want to pick.  As part of this process, we also can verify that the DeviceInputSystem/DeviceSourceManager can talk to the InputManager to propagate pointer events up.\r\n\r\nGUI Input Test: https://playground.babylonjs.com/#UB4F3B#7\r\nThis test validates that GUI elements such as TextBlocks, InputTexts, and Buttons are usable with Keyboard and Mouse input.  Furthermore, this will verify that the 6 observables will work with our buttons (move, up, down, out, enter, click).  While the first test verifies that the DIS/DSM can talk with the InputManager, this one will show that the InputManager can also talk with GUI elements.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that all simulated input is done with Pointer/KeyboardEvent objects and the `dispatchEvent` function.  Some modifications will be needed if these tests are to run on Babylon Native.",

This has led to a scenario where said buttons weren't being properly treated as released.  Upon investigation, it has been determined that this issue occurs at an OS level and therefore, there isn't much we can do about it (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11818637/why-does-javascript-drop-keyup-events-when-the-metakey-is-pressed-on-mac-browser).  This PR contains a workaround so that if BJS is being run in a browser on MacOS, any buttons pressed while the Meta key is active will be tracked and have `keyup` events fired for them when the Meta key is released.  All other platforms will work as before without this tracking code.\r\n\r\nForum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/modifier-keyboard-shortcuts-with-devicesourcemanager-copy-to-clipboard/31743/7",

After investigating the issue, it was found that the mouse events were triggering both mouse and touch movement.  The main issue was that, in FreeCameraTouchInput, the `isMouseEvent` boolean was incorrect being evaluated as false for mouse because the assigning logic was looking for a parameter that isn't available to mouse events generated in Safari.  The fix was to modify the logic to work with Safari-specific mouse events.\r\n\r\nRelevant Forum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/keyboard-control-not-working-for-latest-universalcamera-in-desktop-safari/31314/8",

After some investigation, it was found that the `touchMoveSensibility` property was being used in a denominator inside of the `checkInputs` function.  Because of this, if `touchMoveSensibility` was zero, it'd create a divide by zero scenario that would effectively render the camera's `cameraDirection` vector to be a vector of NaNs.  The fix for this was to just add a check to see if `touchMoveSensibility` was zero and handle things accordingly.\r\n\r\nForum link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/keyboard-control-not-working-for-latest-universalcamera-in-desktop-safari/31314",

When a dummy predicate was used (`() => false`), there was still a pickedmesh/point in the pickInfo object.  This PR does a couple of things:\r\n- Fix for the picking logic to use the `pointerUpPredicate` and actually call `scene.pick`\r\n- Add a boolean to scene that allows the user to skip picking on pointerup (same as move and down)",

Params: name, size, scene\r\n  const box = MeshBuilder.CreateBox(\"box\", { size: 2 }, scene);\r\n\r\n  new FollowCamera(\"ArcRotateCamera\", new Vector3(2, 0, 0), scene, box);\r\n  const light = new HemisphericLight(\"light1\", new Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);\r\n\r\n  // Default intensity is 1. Let's dim the light a small amount\r\n  light.intensity = 0.7;\r\n\r\n  scene.registerBeforeRender(() => {\r\n    if (this.updatePan) {\r\n      (scene.activeCamera as any).alpha -= this._translateX / 6000;\r\n      (scene.activeCamera as any).beta -= this._translateY / 6000;\r\n    }\r\n    if (this.updatePinch) {\r\n      (scene.activeCamera as any).radius -= this._scale * 60;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    gl.endFrameEXP();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  engine.runRenderLoop(() => {\r\n    if (scene) {\r\n      scene.render();\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Cause\r\n\r\nWhat happens here is that at some point, the `Effect` class (packages/dev/core/src/Materials/effect.ts) will try to access the host document by only checking if `IsWindowObjectExist` returns true:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst hostDocument = IsWindowObjectExist() ? this._engine.getHostDocument() : null;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is, in this react-native context `window` will exist but not `document`, leading to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\n\r\nTo fix this,  I added a check in `getHostDocument` to make sure that `document` actually exist before returning it. If it doesn't, I simply return `null`.\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR in this repo, please let me know if I forgot anything.",

Upon closer inspection, it was determined that the logic that was used to detect if the input was from a mouse or not was incorrect.  It originally said that if the browser was a not from mobile browser and if the event was an instance of MouseEvent, that it was from the mouse.  The new logic just checks the pointer type and uses that, which is a much more reliable method and also works with touch devices using non-mobile browsers.\r\n\r\nForum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/guys-i-got-a-problem-with-on-some-android-pad-cant-use-universalcamera-to-move-on-touch/30448/3",

The appropriate way of handling this type of problem would be to check bgfx capabilities and handle it appropriately on the JS side by setting ```canUseTextureForTargets``` property at ```MorphTargetManager```. This PR exposes all capabilities info provided by the Native Engine so they can be accessed by the js NativeEngine and appropriately handled by Babylon.js \r\n\r\n## Aditions\r\n\r\n- Exposed Native engine caps to javascript. \r\n- After this PR gets merged the following [Babylon Native PR](https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/pull/1075) can be merged.\r\n- Fixes [Android Morph Targets](https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/issues/1049) issue on Babylon Native.

This reason for this fix was because a user had identified an issue where the pointerlock was successfully being set but keyboard input wasn't working.  This was due to the fact that requestPointerlock does not set focus when setting the pointerlock element so no keyboard input was being routed to the canvas.  This fix simply sets focus once the pointerlock element has been set.\r\n\r\nThis fix is in reference to this Forum post: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/input-not-recognised-until-window-resize-triggered-or-change-focus/15653",

So, in this case:\r\n```\r\nvar compoundBody = new BABYLON.Mesh(\"compoundBody\", scene);\r\ncompoundBody.position.y=3;\r\n\r\ncompoundBody.computeWorldMatrix(true);\r\nconsole.log(compoundBody.getBoundingInfo().boundingSphere.centerWorld.y);\r\nconsole.log(compoundBody.position.y);\r\n```\r\nmin and max are (0,3,0), bouding sphere local center is (0,3,0).\r\nworld bounding sphere center is local center transformed by world matrix and its value is (0,6, 0) which is not correct. It breaks the physics for oimo and cannon. Computation is different with ammo and was not touched by this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n@RaananW Git blame indicates you changed it last.
