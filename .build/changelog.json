If I change from `private` to `protected`, eslint complains about naming convention, but I wonder whether it is worth to rename.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nprivate static _RotationGizmoFragmentShader\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll leave this as a draft for discussion for now, and meanwhile continue to test the extendability on this PR.\r\n ",

This has been tested with success with all the samples provided as part of the Khronos proposal.\r\nEven if functional, the code is still not very clean and many ehancement must be done in order to reach a certain level of quality. However, calendar issue drive us to put this onto PR rapidely.\r\n[AnimateAllTheThings.zip](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/files/9144599/AnimateAllTheThings.zip)\r\nThis can be tested with the file above, which encompass all the cases supported by the `KHR_animation_pointer`.\r\nThe main changes are located into 3 files.\r\n`GLTFLoader` has been simplified by moving all the animation related code to the `KHR_animation_pointer.ts` where the extension lies. `KHR_animation_pointer.map.ts` contains the pointer tree mapping and miscellaneous function to serve the pointer parsing and logic.\r\nAll the other change are to support indirection between GLTF entities and Babylon ones. This is subject to discussion, because not very \"clean\".\r\nMay close #12544 \r\n",

Press left button, middle button, then right button (Do not let go of any of them)\r\n3. Release them in this order while moving around a bit (Right, Left, Middle)\r\n4. Now camera movement should be locked to your cursor movement\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the DeviceSourceManager/DeviceInputSystem is still storing the correct values.  This fix removes the check from the InputManager.",

                "description": "Illustration showing left and right eyes in a HoloLens 2 running BabylonNative:\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"stereo-clear-artifacts\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4724014/180064594-238f7fc0-6b3f-4aeb-bd45-9c7e5244362b.png\">\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/issues/1087\r\n\r\nThere were two issues going on here. The first is that we needed to render the utility layer _after_ rendering to both eyes in the target scene. By rendering the utility layer scene in between eye renders, we were getting weird clearing behavior that is hard to describe. The second is that we were double-clearing our output render target textures in cases where `RenderTargetTexture.skipInitialClear = false`.\r\n\r\nBy changing the observable used in `utilityLayerRenderer` from `onAfterCameraRenderObservable` to `onAfterRenderCameraObservable`, we're making sure to render the layer only once after finishing both eyes (instead of after the left and before the right and then again after both eyes). This doesn't meaningfully change any behavior in rendering scenarios with cameras without sub-cameras.\r\n\r\nBy checking `Scene.autoClear` when clearing the camera's output render target, we avoid clearing our render targets when rendering multiple scenes that are supposed to layer onto those render targets. This means that clearing behavior when rendering a scene to a render target matches the clearing behavior when rendering that same scene to the default frame buffer. **This is a breaking change for experiences that expected the scene not to honor `autoClear = false` when rendering to a RTT, but this is not documented/expected behavior as far as I know.**\r\n\r\nWe weren't seeing this bug in any other scenario (i.e. Oculus on Web, native iOS, native Android, etc) because on all other platforms `RenderTargetTexture.skipInitialClear = true`, and so we never saw any weird clearing behavior because the RTT's were never getting cleared in the first place, which on those platforms is totally acceptable because they get automatically cleared by either the WebXR runtime or the BabylonNative XR implementation at the top of the frame.\r\n\r\n",

Somehow this WebAPI is defined in regular Babylon Native (there is no native polyfill, so is JSC/V8 providing this?), though it is unnecessary (the `src` property is unused in Babylon Native's `VideoTexture` implementation), and in React Native `window.URL.createObjectURL` is polyfilled partially and dies on this call. Avoiding this call makes `VideoTexture` work in Babylon React Native. The extra direct check for `video.isNative` in the BJS code is not great, but other code in this file already does it, so following the existing pattern.",

This had worked previously in 4.2.  Upon further investigation, it was found that the code used in the InputManager to route the input calls had omitted these buttons.

My original fixes addressed the original logic, which was incorrectly assigning the passive property, and makes the default value true.  This also includes removal of the preventDefault code from some of our cameras.\r\n\r\nThis current PR will accomplish two things.  One, it will revert the changes from 12703.  Second, it will set the default state of the passive property to false.  This should address an issue found in the forums where the original behavior would successfully allow for preventDefault but the newest one wouldn't.\r\n\r\nForum link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/camera-zoom-scrolling-the-page-introduced-in-5-13-1/32223/6",

The conversion constants and formulas are described in the Wikipedia article for sRGB: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB\r\n\r\nI opted to make this option a property passed into the engine, as it feels somewhat similar functionally to the engine option for high precision floats i.e., it affects many things (in this case, many shaders). IMO it would be odd to use the approximation in one shader and the exact formula in another. I think most of the time, you'd either want it always or never.",

                "description": "Stemming from this [prev PR](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/12643) prepareDefines is now called after PrepareDefinesForAttributes so that the plugin's defines aren't overwritten. However some of the built-in plugins rely on prepareDefines being called before PrepareDefinesForAttributes (in particular the ones that call PrepareDefinesForMergedUV which needs to be called before PrepareDefinesForAttributes).\r\n\r\nSo this PR just changes these plugins to use prepareDefinesBeforeAttributes, which is called before PrepareDefinesForAttributes to match the original behavior (this is the same fix that was created for the PBRAnisotropicConfiguration plugin in the original PR, which I thought was the only one affected).\r\n\r\nForum issue about the PBRSheenConfiguration plugin: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/texture-not-displaying-for-sheen-extension/32110",

Additionally, there are tests to verify that our skip booleans (eg. skipPointerUpPredicate) will prevent picking in scenarios where we don't want to pick.  As part of this process, we also can verify that the DeviceInputSystem/DeviceSourceManager can talk to the InputManager to propagate pointer events up.\r\n\r\nGUI Input Test: https://playground.babylonjs.com/#UB4F3B#7\r\nThis test validates that GUI elements such as TextBlocks, InputTexts, and Buttons are usable with Keyboard and Mouse input.  Furthermore, this will verify that the 6 observables will work with our buttons (move, up, down, out, enter, click).  While the first test verifies that the DIS/DSM can talk with the InputManager, this one will show that the InputManager can also talk with GUI elements.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that all simulated input is done with Pointer/KeyboardEvent objects and the `dispatchEvent` function.  Some modifications will be needed if these tests are to run on Babylon Native.",

This has led to a scenario where said buttons weren't being properly treated as released.

This PR contains a workaround so that if BJS is being run in a browser on MacOS, any buttons pressed while the Meta key is active will be tracked and have `keyup` events fired for them when the Meta key is released.  All other platforms will work as before without this tracking code.\r\n\r\nForum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/modifier-keyboard-shortcuts-with-devicesourcemanager-copy-to-clipboard/31743/7",

After investigating the issue, it was found that the mouse events were triggering both mouse and touch movement.  The main issue was that, in FreeCameraTouchInput, the `isMouseEvent` boolean was incorrect being evaluated as false for mouse because the assigning logic was looking for a parameter that isn't available to mouse events generated in Safari.  The fix was to modify the logic to work with Safari-specific mouse events.\r\n\r\nRelevant Forum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/keyboard-control-not-working-for-latest-universalcamera-in-desktop-safari/31314/8",

After some investigation, it was found that the `touchMoveSensibility` property was being used in a denominator inside of the `checkInputs` function.  Because of this, if `touchMoveSensibility` was zero, it'd create a divide by zero scenario that would effectively render the camera's `cameraDirection` vector to be a vector of NaNs.  The fix for this was to just add a check to see if `touchMoveSensibility` was zero and handle things accordingly.\r\n\r\nForum link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/keyboard-control-not-working-for-latest-universalcamera-in-desktop-safari/31314",

When a dummy predicate was used (`() => false`), there was still a pickedmesh/point in the pickInfo object.  This PR does a couple of things:\r\n- Fix for the picking logic to use the `pointerUpPredicate` and actually call `scene.pick`\r\n- Add a boolean to scene that allows the user to skip picking on pointerup (same as move and down)",

Params: name, size, scene\r\n  const box = MeshBuilder.CreateBox(\"box\", { size: 2 }, scene);\r\n\r\n  new FollowCamera(\"ArcRotateCamera\", new Vector3(2, 0, 0), scene, box);\r\n  const light = new HemisphericLight(\"light1\", new Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);\r\n\r\n  // Default intensity is 1. Let's dim the light a small amount\r\n  light.intensity = 0.7;\r\n\r\n  scene.registerBeforeRender(() => {\r\n    if (this.updatePan) {\r\n      (scene.activeCamera as any).alpha -= this._translateX / 6000;\r\n      (scene.activeCamera as any).beta -= this._translateY / 6000;\r\n    }\r\n    if (this.updatePinch) {\r\n      (scene.activeCamera as any).radius -= this._scale * 60;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    gl.endFrameEXP();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  engine.runRenderLoop(() => {\r\n    if (scene) {\r\n      scene.render();\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Cause\r\n\r\nWhat happens here is that at some point, the `Effect` class (packages/dev/core/src/Materials/effect.ts) will try to access the host document by only checking if `IsWindowObjectExist` returns true:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst hostDocument = IsWindowObjectExist() ? this._engine.getHostDocument() : null;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is, in this react-native context `window` will exist but not `document`, leading to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\n\r\nTo fix this,  I added a check in `getHostDocument` to make sure that `document` actually exist before returning it. If it doesn't, I simply return `null`.\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR in this repo, please let me know if I forgot anything.",

Upon closer inspection, it was determined that the logic that was used to detect if the input was from a mouse or not was incorrect.  It originally said that if the browser was a not from mobile browser and if the event was an instance of MouseEvent, that it was from the mouse.  The new logic just checks the pointer type and uses that, which is a much more reliable method and also works with touch devices using non-mobile browsers.\r\n\r\nForum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/guys-i-got-a-problem-with-on-some-android-pad-cant-use-universalcamera-to-move-on-touch/30448/3",

The appropriate way of handling this type of problem would be to check bgfx capabilities and handle it appropriately on the JS side by setting ```canUseTextureForTargets``` property at ```MorphTargetManager```. This PR exposes all capabilities info provided by the Native Engine so they can be accessed by the js NativeEngine and appropriately handled by Babylon.js \r\n\r\n## Aditions\r\n\r\n- Exposed Native engine caps to javascript. \r\n- After this PR gets merged the following [Babylon Native PR](https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/pull/1075) can be merged.\r\n- Fixes [Android Morph Targets](https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/issues/1049) issue on Babylon Native.

This reason for this fix was because a user had identified an issue where the pointerlock was successfully being set but keyboard input wasn't working.  This was due to the fact that requestPointerlock does not set focus when setting the pointerlock element so no keyboard input was being routed to the canvas.  This fix simply sets focus once the pointerlock element has been set.\r\n\r\nThis fix is in reference to this Forum post: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/input-not-recognised-until-window-resize-triggered-or-change-focus/15653",

So, in this case:\r\n```\r\nvar compoundBody = new BABYLON.Mesh(\"compoundBody\", scene);\r\ncompoundBody.position.y=3;\r\n\r\ncompoundBody.computeWorldMatrix(true);\r\nconsole.log(compoundBody.getBoundingInfo().boundingSphere.centerWorld.y);\r\nconsole.log(compoundBody.position.y);\r\n```\r\nmin and max are (0,3,0), bouding sphere local center is (0,3,0).\r\nworld bounding sphere center is local center transformed by world matrix and its value is (0,6, 0) which is not correct. It breaks the physics for oimo and cannon. Computation is different with ammo and was not touched by this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n@RaananW Git blame indicates you changed it last.
