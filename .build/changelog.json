When a dummy predicate was used (`() => false`), there was still a pickedmesh/point in the pickInfo object.  This PR does a couple of things:\r\n- Fix for the picking logic to use the `pointerUpPredicate` and actually call `scene.pick`\r\n- Add a boolean to scene that allows the user to skip picking on pointerup (same as move and down)",

Params: name, size, scene\r\n  const box = MeshBuilder.CreateBox(\"box\", { size: 2 }, scene);\r\n\r\n  new FollowCamera(\"ArcRotateCamera\", new Vector3(2, 0, 0), scene, box);\r\n  const light = new HemisphericLight(\"light1\", new Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);\r\n\r\n  // Default intensity is 1. Let's dim the light a small amount\r\n  light.intensity = 0.7;\r\n\r\n  scene.registerBeforeRender(() => {\r\n    if (this.updatePan) {\r\n      (scene.activeCamera as any).alpha -= this._translateX / 6000;\r\n      (scene.activeCamera as any).beta -= this._translateY / 6000;\r\n    }\r\n    if (this.updatePinch) {\r\n      (scene.activeCamera as any).radius -= this._scale * 60;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    gl.endFrameEXP();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  engine.runRenderLoop(() => {\r\n    if (scene) {\r\n      scene.render();\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Cause\r\n\r\nWhat happens here is that at some point, the `Effect` class (packages/dev/core/src/Materials/effect.ts) will try to access the host document by only checking if `IsWindowObjectExist` returns true:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst hostDocument = IsWindowObjectExist() ? this._engine.getHostDocument() : null;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is, in this react-native context `window` will exist but not `document`, leading to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\n\r\nTo fix this,  I added a check in `getHostDocument` to make sure that `document` actually exist before returning it. If it doesn't, I simply return `null`.\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR in this repo, please let me know if I forgot anything.",

                "description": "A user in the forums found that there was no touch input working with the universal camera, which uses FreeCameraTouchInput as part of its attached inputs.  Upon closer inspection, it was determined that the logic that was used to detect if the input was from a mouse or not was incorrect.  It originally said that if the browser was a not from mobile browser and if the event was an instance of MouseEvent, that it was from the mouse.  The new logic just checks the pointer type and uses that, which is a much more reliable method and also works with touch devices using non-mobile browsers.\r\n\r\nForum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/guys-i-got-a-problem-with-on-some-android-pad-cant-use-universalcamera-to-move-on-touch/30448/3",

                "description": "## Overview\r\n\r\nMorph targets are currently failing on Babylon Native when running on Android since bgfx does not support Texture2D arrays for Android API BGFX_CONFIG_RENDERER_OPENGLES lower than 31 (currently set to 30). The appropriate way of handling this type of problem would be to check bgfx capabilities and handle it appropriately on the JS side by setting ```canUseTextureForTargets``` property at ```MorphTargetManager```. This PR exposes all capabilities info provided by the Native Engine so they can be accessed by the js NativeEngine and appropriately handled by Babylon.js \r\n\r\n## Aditions\r\n\r\n- Exposed Native engine caps to javascript. \r\n- After this PR gets merged the following [Babylon Native PR](https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/pull/1075) can be merged.\r\n- Fixes [Android Morph Targets](https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/issues/1049) issue on Babylon Native.

                "description": "In between 4.2 and 5.0, we switched to calculating text width using the `actualBoundingBox` properties rather than the `width`. These properties are more accurate, but they are not available in older browsers. This means that text would no longer render correctly on older browsers.\r\n\r\nThe simple fix here is to add feature testing so that we fallback to using `width` if `actualBoundingBox` is not defined.\r\n\r\nSome playgrounds to demonstrate this:\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#44KYLP\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#XCPP9Y#1\r\n\r\nThese were previously broken on Chrome/73.0.3683.75 but will now render the text correctly.\r\n\r\nSee forum issue: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/babylonjs-v5-0-and-chromium/29938",

This reason for this fix was because a user had identified an issue where the pointerlock was successfully being set but keyboard input wasn't working.  This was due to the fact that requestPointerlock does not set focus when setting the pointerlock element so no keyboard input was being routed to the canvas.  This fix simply sets focus once the pointerlock element has been set.\r\n\r\nThis fix is in reference to this Forum post: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/input-not-recognised-until-window-resize-triggered-or-change-focus/15653",
