So, in this case:\r\n```\r\nvar compoundBody = new BABYLON.Mesh(\"compoundBody\", scene);\r\ncompoundBody.position.y=3;\r\n\r\ncompoundBody.computeWorldMatrix(true);\r\nconsole.log(compoundBody.getBoundingInfo().boundingSphere.centerWorld.y);\r\nconsole.log(compoundBody.position.y);\r\n```\r\nmin and max are (0,3,0), bouding sphere local center is (0,3,0).\r\nworld bounding sphere center is local center transformed by world matrix and its value is (0,6, 0) which is not correct. It breaks the physics for oimo and cannon. Computation is different with ammo and was not touched by this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n@RaananW Git blame indicates you changed it last.
