It is the simplification off the following equation:\r\n`q' = to_quaternion(M * to_matrix(q) * M^-1)`\r\n     * where M is the conversion matrix `convertHandednessMatrix`, M^-1 is its inverse, \r\n     * q is the input quaternion, q' is the converted quaternion.\r\n     * to_matrix() and to_quaternion() are derived from [the figures and methods here](https://d3cw3dd2w32x2b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/matrix-to-quat.pdf)\r\n     \r\nIt's possible to simplify further, but less readable IMO, so I've left its structure as similar as possible to the reference above.",

Guardrails and validation will come in future PRs.\r\n\r\n- Add `ScreenUVBlock`, which corresponds to the UV varying passed by `postprocess.vertex`, which is used by Smart Filters\r\n- Reuse `NodeMaterialModes.PostProcess` logic for creating the effect in the preview canvas. This avoid adding any more SFE-specific logic to `NodeMaterial` proper.\r\n- Add `Export to SFE` button",

                "description": "This change does 3 things to speed up the playwright audio tests:\r\n\r\n1. Loads only the bare minimum html needed to run the tests:\r\n\t- The tests are currently loading empty.html from the CDN, which downloads a lot more than the audio tests need.\r\n\t- This change loads custom html with an empty body and 2 scripts from the CDN; babylon.js and audiov2-test.js.\r\n\r\n2. Uses the WebAudio API `OfflineAudioContext` in place of the realtime `AudioContext` where possible.\r\n\t- The `OfflineAudioContext` renders audio faster than realtime and can be used for most of the audio tests. Notable exceptions are the streaming sound tests and the current time tests.\r\n\r\n3. Passes less test result info from the playwright browser back to Node:\r\n\t- The tests are currently passing the captured audio to Node after every test, which is expensive.\r\n\t- This change does the required audio processing in the playwright browser and only passes the result back to Node, which is much smaller than the entire captured audio array.\r\n\r\nThis takes the AudioEngineCI pipeline \"run tests\" step from 38 minutes to 12.",

                "description": "This change is in response to feedback from users that certain models don't render in the Viewer (@alexandremottet). For the model in question, the problem is that it has a bunch of unused uv sets in the vertex data, which exceed the WebGPU limits, and WebGPU is the default for the Viewer in many cases. The fix is to add a utility function that removes uv sets that are in the vertex data but unreferenced by any material.\r\n- Add `removeVerticesData` to `AbstractMesh`, and add an implementation in `InstancedMesh`.\r\n- Add a `RemoveUnreferencedVerticesData` helper function to core.\r\n- Call `RemoveUnreferencedVerticesData` after loading a model in the Viewer.\r\n\r\nI also included a few other small fixes in this PR:\r\n- Fix the naming of `CreateViewerForCanvas` (it was inadvertently exported with the wrong casing). This is a breaking change, but the API is marked as `@experimental`, so I think we should go ahead and fix it and if we get asks, we can always export the old casing and mark it deprecated.\r\n- Export `ConfigureCustomViewerElement` (it was missing from the top level exports, but is part of the public API).\r\n- Expose a `ViewerElement.reload` function, which is needed when replacing the `reload-button` slot (previously it called a private function, which external code could not do).\r\n- Remove the `animationAutoPlay` option from the Configurator's use of `LoadModelOptions` as this option no longer exists.",

                "description": "It's possible that when rapidly disposing a dynamicTexture, a delayed callback gets ran on the disposed instance, resulting in a TypeError exception caused by accessing a null instance. The specific case that was causing this issue was when `Tools.SetImmediate` is used to pend some future work to `update` the dynamic texture, and by the time this delayed callback was running, the dynamicTexture had already been disposed.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to early out of the `update` function if `this._texture` is already null. This simply avoids dereferencing a null engine when calling `_getEngine().updateDynamicTexture(this._texture, ...)`. In any case, `updateDynamicTexture` itself already early outs when the texture parameter is null, so it should not change that behavior.",

Interpolation block was not providing the context to the animation function\n4. Matcher for json pointer didn't work correctly if the matched item was at the end of the string\n5. pointer/interpolate should use the BezierEasing and not the normal easing block\n6.

When inside and outside IOR's match, specular reflectance should go to zero. However, because the BRDF texture is baked for an IOR of 1.5 and we only use IOR to modify F0, the specular reflectance at glancing angles ends up very wrong when IOR gets close to 1.0.\r\n\r\nI've added a linear scale to the F90 value to help account for this. It's still not correct, of course. We'd need to do the actual Fresnel calculations for the given IOR to fully fix the problem (note that the Schlick approximation is not sufficient).\r\n\r\nIBL:\r\n![ReflectanceIOR](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc24a000-fde9-4e03-9229-587d7cf06e69)\r\n\r\nAnalytic Lights\r\n![ReflectanceIOR_analytic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/212383f4-8178-48a9-9087-06c7b8815f57)\r\n",

This should cover any cases where meshes use only a subsection of the vertex buffer, starting from its beginning. There should not be any cases where the `maxTotalVertices` < the union of the ranges of the buffer that are used by individual meshes.\r\n- Factor out common vertex buffer info retrieval into utility function, `GetVertexBufferInfo`\r\n- Simple visual test based on playground from above.

                "description": "This PR aims to solve a couple of different but overlapping problems:\r\n- More flexibility in the reset logic (forum issue: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/viewer-v2-reset-button-to-the-initial-explicitly-specified-camera-pose/56925)\r\n- Make it possible to initialize the Viewer from JSON (allows the Viewer Configurator to be used with all layers of the Viewer, not just the HTML layer, and also creates a path for saving/loading to/from snippet server)\r\n\r\nChanges to the Configurator will come in a subsequent PR. For this PR, the overall changes are as follows:\r\n## Viewer\r\n- Flesh out `ViewerOptions` with *most* properties of the Viewer.\r\n- Expose a `DefaultViewerOptions` object, which is used for Viewer initialization and will also be used by the Configurator.\r\n- Add a `reset` function that helps reset Viewer state to the initial state (based on passed in options and default options).\r\n- Use this reset state and logic in the Viewer layer and remove old `UpdateModelOptions` that was needed to coordinate reset logic that was spread across `Viewer` and `ViewerElement`.\r\n- Update the `resetCamera` function to be more configurable (reframe the camera (current logic), reset the camera to the initial state, or pick a reasonable default based on Viewer state).\r\n- Add an `updateCamera` function that will interpolate to a new pose.\r\n- Remove `FramingBehavior`. It was used in early versions of the Viewer, but at this point the Viewer's framing logic has superseded `FramingBehavior` and it is no longer needed.\r\n- Move all hotspot state and logic down to the Viewer layer.\r\n\r\n## ViewerFactory\r\n- Wrap the passed through options in a `Proxy`, which makes is possible for the higher layers (e.g. `ViewerElement`) to override the default options dynamically (used to allow element attributes to behave as default options).\r\n\r\n## ViewerElement\r\n- Initialize properties/attributes based on the passed in options (since they now have most of the Viewer properties).\r\n- Pass `ViewerOptions` down that return attributes if they are set, otherwise the passed in option value. This makes it so if an attribute is dynamically updated, it becomes the configured value that is used by the reset logic.\r\n- Change `camera-orbit` and `camera-target` to be custom handled attributes (not reactive properties). There is a lot of special handling to get the desired behavior for camera pose, so the reactive property pattern is not helpful anymore.\r\n- Add a `resetMode` property/attribute, and a `reset` function. The behavior of the `reset` function (called when the reset button is clicked) depends on the `resetMode`. This is what finally addresses the forum issue.\r\n- Remove `syncToAttribute` logic that was previously used for reset logic (since reset logic moved down to the Viewer layer).\r\n- Remove logic to reset camera state, since it also moved down to the Viewer layer.\r\n- Remove `UpdateModelOptions` related args previously passed to `Viewer.loadModel` as this is now all handled in the Viewer layer.\r\n- Remove all hotspot implementation since it is now handled in the Viewer layer.",

For example `analyzer.fftSize = 128; console.log(analyzer.fftSize);` prints the default `2048` until the async `analyzer` subproperty init is complete. This is confusing for users.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes the issue by using backing variables for properties on lazy-loaded sound and bus subproperties.",

                "description": "This PR makes several improvements to the existing ArcRotateCamera interpolation logic:\r\n- Allows overlapping interpolations. For example, if you start an interpolation of alpha, and before it is finished start an interpolation of the y component of the target, it previously would always stop the previous interpolation. Now it is possible for them to overlap, but passing in `NaN` for the components you don't want to interpolate. This is perhaps a little unusual, but it's the least disruptive to the API. Still, open to alternate suggestions.\r\n- Ensures the camera orbit/target/etc. eventually reach the actual interpolation goal values. Previously, it would stop the interpolation when it was \"close,\" but not actually bring the values to the final goal values.\r\n- Because of the previous point, I had to improve the logic for determining when we are \"close\" to the final goal values, to ensure \"close\" is visually indistinguishable from the final value.\r\n  - For target, it is relative to the radius. This ensures it visually always looks the same regardless of scale.\r\n  - For rotation, it is just an absolute value (0.0002 radians), which was chosen empirically by just seeing what looked visually indistinguishable.\r\n  - For radius, it is when we are 99.9% of the way to the goal, which again should work well regardless of scale.\r\n  - For target screen offset, it is just an absolute value, same as previous actually.\r\n- Swaps the order to applying user input and applying interpolation. This way, if there is any user input, we don't add in a small and unnecessary and incorrect interpolation first (size of the change depends on frame time). Also, it means we don't need to repeat the checks for user input twice.\r\n- Add a `stopInterpolation` function to make it easier to interrupt an in-progress interpolation.\r\n- Unit tests for the interpolation logic.",

Changing those options on a sound with multiple instances playing only updates the most recent instance, but it should update all instances.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, allowing the `playbackRate` and `pitch` options to be set in the `play` function is confusing because the parent sound's properties will override the new instance's option set by the `play` function, which will cause the playback rate and pitch to change unexpectedly when the sound's properties are changed.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes these issues by making the static sound's `playbackRate` and `pitch` properties apply to all playing instances, and by removing the `playbackRate` and `pitch` options from the `play` function.",

This ensures we can correctly render the final high res frame (before suspend completes) within a single frame (e.g. single call to scene.render). It will be slightly slower since it is not using snapshot rendering, but this is fine for rendering a single frame (fast snapshot rendering is mostly useful for continuous rendering).",

Otherwise, every call to resize will scale the canvas and it just gets bigger and bigger until it crashes the browser. This will happen if the canvas width or height is 0, which we initially discovered when testing the Viewer Configurator on iOS (where the width ends up being 0 because the side pane takes up the full horizontal width of the device). However, you can easily repro this in other tools. For example, if you put Playground on a high dpi device (DPR>1), reduce the width of the window, toggle to only show the code (now the canvas css width is 0), and then resize the window, the canvas width will explode:\r\n<img width=\"387\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5464ad9-bc45-4c99-8168-c0cde03c6464\" />\r\n",

Using IWER (as the original PR) and not an extension, as browserstack does not support installing extensions as part of the test run.\n\nThe idea here is to not change anything in core classes and other tests. The only thing changed is the new testing mechanism.

If `StandardMaterial` has not been imported, `scene.defaultMaterial` throws. This change fixes that.\r\n- Add a `_hasDefaultMaterial` internal property (could make it non-internal if we want it to be part of the public API). This works by seeing if `Scene.DefaultMaterialFactory` has been assigned to something other than the default value. This makes it so that even if `Scene.DefaultMaterialFactory` has been set to a factory function other than the one in `StandardMaterial`, it still works (e.g. default material does not have to be `StandardMaterial` for this mechanism to work).\r\n- A couple places on the common hot path that recently started accessing `Scene.defaultMaterial` now check `_hasDefaultMaterial` first. This is just a property evaluation, so I think the perf impact should be negligible.\r\n- I had \"fixed\" this problem in the Viewer first by setting `Scene.blockMaterialDirtyMechanism` when creating the skybox material, but I kept that change anyway because I think it is slightly better. It's the same thing the glTF loader does for example.\r\n- While testing this to make sure it doesn't regress the point mode fix from the previous PR, I noticed that inspector fails if `animatable.ts` has not been imported (e.g. if you didn't explicitly import it yourself or load a model with animations). So I also included a very small change to fix this.\r\n\r\nI'd like to get this PR in since it is a bug reported on the forum, and see about adding a Viewer test that can catch this separately. But we can block this PR on adding a test if anyone feels strongly about tying them together.",

However, globalMatrix was (incorrectly) in LHS. The solution is to provide the global matrix in RHS as well. I am doing it by inverting the root node's transformation and multiplying it. This way we support RHS (identity) and LHS (rotation/scaling combination).\n\nThis PR also changes the JSONPointer block and the getproperty block to be a cached operation, meaning calculations will only be done once per execusion. This will optimize the execusion.",

                "description": "As I mentioned on the [forum](https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/text-is-not-shown-in-3d-gui-using-webgpu/57005) text in 3D GUI is not shown on my machine when using WebGPU.\r\n\r\n1. After a debugging session I found the issue in the shader, we used clip space coordinates with textureLoad which takes texture coordinates. It seems that most GPUs (but not my AMD 780M) optimise textures to use clip space dimensions.\r\n2. Looks like after [discussion](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2324) with webGPU 4 years ago they implemented flipY flag, so now we can simply use `this._device.queue.copyExternalImageToTexture({ source: imageBitmap, flipY: true }, ...);` for most of cases, except for `imageBitmap as Uint8Array` as we can't call it with `Uint8Array`\r\n3. I noticed that the result of `PREMULTIPLYALPHA` (in `invertYPreMultiplyAlphaFragmentSource`) is not used because it is always overwritten by `color`\r\n4. Looks like copyWithInvertY is unused\r\n\r\nThanks, feel free to change the code if I made a mistake\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It looked like everything was working, but I later noticed errors in the browser console like indicating several expected shaders did not exist (no idea why these don't show up in the VSCode debug console, which is why I missed it originally). When I dug into this, I found that in fact dynamically importing most shaders is currently broken, and has been for about 4 months. The issue is that after a refactor, we ended up with code that awaits a function rather than awaiting the result of the function because the actual invocation of the function was missing. That means the code that tries to dynamically import shaders never even executes. I would have thought this would break a lot of scenarios (basically any consumer that is not relying on side effects to statically import the shaders), so I'm quite surprised it went unnoticed this long. 🤷🏻‍♂️",

This is due to a confluence of other issues:\r\n1. `LoadImage` uses `EngineStore.LastEngine` and accesses `engine._features`\r\n2. `EngineStore.LastEngine` is set synchronously when the engine is constructed, but `WebGPUEngine` sets `_features` asynchronously during `initAsync`.\r\n3. We don't have the `strictPropertyInitialization` TS flag enabled, which means it's easy for these kinds of issues to slip through (where `_features` is declared as non-nullable but in fact can be null/undefined).\r\n\r\nTargeted fix is to just allow an engine instance to be passed to `LoadImage`, and doing so in the specific code path that is failing.

                "description": "I've noticed an issue with the CDF irradiance filtering when the cube texture size is below 256. The resulting irradiance brightness varies considerably (and usually gets darker) with different resolutions. The issue seems to be that the conversion from equirectangular to cubemap loses some of the bright spots in the original map (or changes the balance of bright pixels to dark ones). This is an especially big problem for mobile devices since the prefiltered cubemap can't seem to be bigger than 64 without causing the WebGL context to be lost.\r\n\r\nThe 'supersample' option when creating an HDRCubeTexture fixes this issue entirely as it compensates for the missing resolution with more samples. For this reason, I think it makes sense to force supersampling when CDF filtering is enabled.",

This is not currently configurable, but I think this is a net improvement since previously it was always locked in at the bottom of the dynamic range introduced with this change. If we get asks from users, we can make this more configurable.\r\n\r\nSome notes on this change:\r\n- Previously it was possible for `HardwareScalingOptimization` to go beyond the specified `maximumScale`, so I made a small fix for this.\r\n- Whenever a model is loaded, we reset hardware scaling back to its original value and then let `SceneOptimzer` re-run.\r\n- Since the scene doesn't render continuously (e.g. we suspend scene rendering when nothing is changing), we also stop/start the scene optimizer when scene rendering suspends/resumes.\r\n- We now take into account the hardware scaling level when computing the screen space coordinates of hotspot annotations (so the value is in css pixels, which is what we want for laying out html elements).",

                "description": "In this change, I am embedding a default environment as a base64 encoded data uri. When resetting the environment, if there is no env texture for IBL and there are PBR materials in the scene, we now use this default env. It is loaded via a dynamic import, so the user won't pay the cost if they provide their own environment.\r\n\r\nI checked the size of the gzipped js file with the base64 default env vs. the gzipped size of the env itself, and the difference was actually negligible (60kb for base64, 59kb for the env file), so I think this is a good approach to avoid external dependencies on CDNs.",

This meant that instead of being parallel to the camera’s clip (screen) plane, the drag plane always faced the camera. Because perspective cameras cause rays to converge, dragging objects off-center led to an inconsistent intersection between the pointer ray and the drag plane—resulting in the mesh drifting toward the camera.\r\n\r\nThis PR just explicitly aligns the drag plane with the camera’s forward direction (i.e., parallel to the view plane) rather than having it face the camera's position.",

We could use `uniqueId`, but I don't see any reason we don't just compare the actual mesh object reference, so this is what I've done in this PR. As far as I can tell things are working as expected with this change.\r\n\r\nCC @j-te since it looks like you implemented this (almost two years ago!).",

                "description": "There was a change in lighting lately, but our tests didn't catch the changes due to the configuration of color-difference per pixel (threshold was 10%). This threshold was now reduced to 3%, and the number of changed pixels was lowered to 1% (strict!).\nThis resulted in many tests slightly failing.\n\nAll font-based tests have received a higher trheshold and other tests as well, depending on the test in hand.\n\nPlease review each of those, and check if it is in your responsibility. If it is, please check if the change makes sense or if something is wrong!\n\nI also had to update a few playgrounds that simply didn't work correctly.\n\nNote that some tests are still failing - deliberatly. I wanted to ask the people who added them to go over them and see what the reason for such a high change in pixels.",

                "description": "On touch devices, tapping on a mesh results in a pointer down without a previous pointer move operation.  _pointerDownEvent() in the webDeviceInputSystem will notify about a move input after processing a down input, but during the down input, we trigger the  OnPickDownTrigger handler and currently pass along stale information about the meshUnderPointer.  In mouse scenarios, this is unlikely to be a problem, since a move would have likely been processed before the down.  \r\n\r\nWith this change, the ActionEvent created to hand off to the OnPickDownTrigger handler will no longer ask the scene for the current meshUnderPointer, but instead will just use the picked mesh for that value, since that's always the most up to date, and always correct in the context of a down operation.\r\n\r\nThis issue was reported in the forum: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/onpickdowntrigger-for-touch-devices/56497",

However, this left us in a state where thrown errors end up in ignored `Promise`s, and so you just see an unhandled error in the console log, rather than the error propagating to the caller through a final `Promise` and/or `onError` callback. This change tries to catch those missed cases and route them correctly, but at this point the code is very hard to reason about and understand where additional error handling is needed. Since there is no synchronous path anymore, we should rewrite a lot of this code to just use async/await, and have the callback based functions just be wrappers that still exist for back compat. This would make it way easier to understand and maintain the code. That said, this should probably be a post-8.0 release change.",

I felt that trying to simplify it was too complicated and error-prone, so I made changes to simply use the `transparencyMode` parameter when set and keep the existing code-path otherwise.\r\n\r\nAt some point, we could deprecate the existing code and keep only the code related to `transparencyMode`. In addition, I think it's easier to document the breaking change:\r\n* if you give a non-null value to `transparencyMode`, it will always be honored, whatever values you give to other properties (like mesh visibility, material alpha, etc)\r\n* If `transparencyMode` is null, no change is made to the existing behavior, which is fully compatible with the past.\r\n\r\nOther changes (from Gary's PR):\r\n* `_shouldTurnAlphaTestOn` has been renamed to `needAlphaTestingForMesh`. This is not a breaking change, since `_shouldTurnAlphaTestOn` was **protected**, and more in line with the existing `needAlphaBlendingForMesh` method.\r\n* All occurrences of `needAlphaTesting` have been replaced by `needAlphaTestingForMesh`: the behavior might change because of this, but it's not a breaking change but a bug fix.\r\n\r\nRegarding failed visualization tests (3):\r\n* \"NME loop block\". It didn't fail because of the changes but because of timing issues (a node material was loaded in parallel to the test - I now wait for the material to load before returning from the `createScene` function).\r\n* \"Visibility\" and \"Prepass SSAO + visibility\" are in fact the same test. They are expected to fail, as they set `transparencyMode=OPAQUE` and define certain properties that allow blending in the current code path, whereas with the PR, the material is no longer transparent. To correct the tests, I set `transparencyMode=ALPHABLEND` and `useAlphaFromAlbedoTexture=false`. Indeed, when `useAlphaFromAlbedoTexture=true` (as was the case in the test), the alpha of the albedo texture is taken into account when `transparencyMode=ALPHABLEND` (as expected), but not in the actual code path when `transparencyMode=OPAQUE`. So the images were different if I didn't set `useAlphaFromAlbedoTexture` to `false`.\r\n\r\ncc @sebavan and @bghgary ",

The primary goal of this feature is to enable matching the POV of cameras defined in a GLTF file, without switching the active camera to try to keep a \"simple\" experience for non-expert users.\r\n\r\n- `_cameraToHotSpot` function compute the `alpha`, `beta`, and `radius` angles, as well as the target point for a camera that is not an `ArcRotateCamera`.\r\n- For target selection, I used a straightforward approach, the target point is determined based on the camera's forward ray. If an intersection with the `meshes` from `AssetContainer` is found, the first hit point is used as the target. If no intersection is detected, a fallback target is calculated by projecting the distance between the camera and the `AssetContainer` world center along the forward ray.",

The idea is to reduce resource pressure and not destroy the battery on a mobile device.\r\n\r\nI have two problems remaining for this PR:\r\n1. ~Sometimes (it's hard to repro) I can get into a state where the camera position jumps back and forth between two very close positions (like the `y` value of the position has a difference of .000000000001). This makes `_isSynchronizedProjectionMatrix` return true every frame. I don't think this has anything to do with my PR, I think this is a pre-existing bug that we just don't notice. Since it is hard to repro, I haven't been able to figure out what causes it yet.~\r\n2. ~Very rarely I get an error related to WebGPU snapshot rendering mode where it thinks the gpu bundle is out of date, and then nothing renders (so rare, but catastrophic). I don't know why this happens, but I'm guessing some kind of timing issue.~\r\n\r\nEdit: After merging master, I'm no longer able to repro the first of the above issues. I can still repro the second issue, especially with complex models.\r\nEdit: After bringing in fixes from @Popov72, the first issue appears to be fixed.",

Set the default animation, which implicitly resets the camera (therefore discarding the camera-orbit and camera-target)\r\n\r\nThis PR both fixes this problem, and introduces some new Playwright automated tests.

The implementation is based on reference repo https://github.com/selfshadow/ltc_code/ and uses the Linearly Transformed Cosines technique described by [Eric Heitz, Jonathan Dupuy, Stephen Hill and David Neubelt`s paper in 2016](https://eheitzresearch.wordpress.com/415-2/) . This PR only supports single color rectangular area lights with texture support been introduced in a latter PR. This PR also does not support shadows for the RectAreaLight. \r\n\r\n# API\r\n\r\nBesides the usual diffuse and specular colors the area light is defined by a position, a width and a height. Setting a rotation is possible by assigning a transform node as a parent for the light. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar light = new BABYLON.RectAreaLight(\"areaLight\", position, width, height, scene);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default shaders will use LTC data stored in the Babylon.js CDN. However, users can assign their own ```IAreaLightLTCProvider``` to ```scene.areaLightLTCProvider``` and use their own LTC textures. \r\n",

                "description": "With some recent refactoring I broke `animation-auto-play`. Previously it was doing some juggling with responsibilities split across the `Viewer` and the `ViewerElement`. With this change, I moved all the responsibility to the `Viewer`, dependent on load options. This makes it much simpler to ensure the logic is correct. An alternative would be to make the `ViewerElement` entirely responsible, and have it sequentially load the model, then set the selectedAnimation, then play the animation. The only reason I don't want to do it this way is because changing the selectedAnimation animates the camera pose (based on computed bounds), and when the model is first being loaded, we don't want this animation. So it's either add load options for the Viewer, or expose the `selectAnimation` function so the `ViewerElement` can select an animation without animating the camera pose. But since other view framework layers would want the same behavior, I think it's better to do it in the `Viewer`.",

                "description": "This PR adds the ability to export to glTF using Draco encoding. Some notes:\r\n\r\n### KHR_draco_mesh_compression\r\n- Usage:\r\n```\r\nBABYLON.GLTF2Export.GLTFAsync(scene, \"fileName\", {  meshCompressionMethod: \"Draco\" });\r\n```\r\n- Using Draco compression will increase export time, especially if the scene to export contains many unique meshes.\r\n- A primitive's vertex data + indices are either fully Draco-compressed or not. As such:\r\n  -  No uncompressed \"fallback\" data is exported if a primitive is Draco-compressed. This can be improved in future iterations.\r\n  -  KHR_draco_mesh_compression will be a required extension if any primitive in the glTF is successfully Draco-compressed\r\n- The encoder options used in the glTF exporter are defined as follows:\r\n```\r\nconst DefaultEncoderOptions: IDracoEncoderOptions = {\r\n    decodeSpeed: 5,\r\n    encodeSpeed: 5,\r\n    method: \"MESH_EDGEBREAKER_ENCODING\", // Or, if primitive contains morph targets, \"MESH_SEQUENTIAL_ENCODING\"\r\n    quantizationBits: {\r\n        POSITION: 14,\r\n        NORMAL: 10,\r\n        COLOR: 8,\r\n        TEX_COORD: 12,\r\n        GENERIC: 12,\r\n    },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### glTF Exporter\r\n- Creation of bufferViews and accessors are all done in the same way, through an intermediate class to help track relationships\r\n- Final binary buffer is no longer built on-the-go, but instead only once requested via generateBinaryAsync\r\n- Fixed glTF validation errors related to byte alignment, among other small buffer-related warnings\r\n\r\n",

This does not change the *public* API of the Viewer.\r\n\r\n- Viewer class now stores the parts of the \"viewer details\" instead of an instance of ViewerDetails and makes them protected to expose them to subclasses.\r\n- Various other members of Viewer class are now protected as well.\r\n- Viewer class now has a protected function that helps track progress of any async operation, which is fed into the overall loading progress state.\r\n- Viewer class has a protected `_loadModel` function that was factored out of `_updateModel`. It loads a model, but does not unload the current model.\r\n- Viewer class now has an internal concept of a \"model,\" which encapsulates the asset container, the material variant controller, and some of the core functions like hotspot querying scoped to a specific model.\r\n- Viewer class has a protected `_model` property and corresponding `_setModel` function that can be used to specify an \"active\" model (Viewer level functionality like animations, hotspots, etc. target the \"active\" model).\r\n- `createViewerForCanvas` factory function now has an overload that augments the options to allow a custom Viewer derived class to be used.\r\n- Introduced an abstract `ViewerElement` class that is just the pre-existing `HTML3DElement`, but without the custom element registration. `HTML3DElement` is now a trivial subclass of `ViewerElement`.\r\n- `ViewerElement` is generic, and allows a subclass to specify the type of the `Viewer` class it uses and provide typesafe access to it.\r\n- `ViewerElement` has a protected `_createViewer` function that is used by `_setupViewer`, and allows subclasses to do additional async setup work.\r\n- `HTML3DAnnotationElement` now robustly handles the possibility of the parent `ViewerElement` not being registered (e.g. `customElements.define`) until after the `HTML3DAnnotationElement` is connected to the DOM (thanks @cournoll!).",

Please let me know of better ideas for this :)",

The fix is simply to call `this._createOffsetsBuffer()` earlier so that the correct vertex buffer is created (cc @RolandCsibrei, to make sure it's the right fix / in the right place).\r\n\r\n[This PG](https://playground.babylonjs.com/?webgpu#LPTLZM#298) crashes for the same reason, but the fix is a bit more complex as we shouldn't use an attribute in a node material if the mesh using that material doesn't support the attribute. So I've added some code to declare a regular (dummy) variable with the same name as the attribute when the latter is not supported.\r\n\r\nNote that I also added some debug code (mostly labels) to ease debugging in WebGPU.",

                "description": "While working on the frame graph, I noticed that we had a problem with LOD management when using custom render target textures.\r\nTake this PG:\r\n\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#WSWPUJ#1\r\n\r\nThe large sphere comes from the main rendering, which uses a camera located at a distance of 10 from the sphere.\r\nThe small sphere comes from a render target texture (RTT), which is displayed on a vertical plane and uses a camera located at a distance of 30 from the sphere.\r\nA LOD (box) has been defined for the sphere, at a distance of 15.\r\nWe should therefore see a box instead of the small sphere, as 30 > 15.\r\n\r\n|What we see|What we should see|\r\n|-|-|\r\n|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ef2db32-4007-4349-a19e-b0bba530e7de)|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8959f162-3694-4c13-be87-db1fdf7c6dff)|\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work because the LOD is calculated for the main camera and reused for all custom RTTs.\r\nThe PR updates the LOD management by storing the LOD per camera.\r\nIn addition, I've introduced a `cameraForLOD` property in `ObjectRenderer` / `RenderTargetTexture`, because we may want to use a LOD for a camera that is different from `ObjectRenderer.activeCamera` (think of rendering from a light: the LOD should be retrieved from the main camera, not from the light's point of view). If not supplied, `cameraForLOD=activeCamera` to maintain backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nOther changes in this PR are frame graph related:\r\n* added the `camera` entry to the shadow generator frame graph task. I hadn't originally added this entry because we didn't need it for rendering, but we do need it to retrieve a correct LOD (which is also why I added the new `ObjectRenderer.cameraForLOD` property).\r\n* fixed a bug with DoF task in WebGL\r\n* added visualization tests\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n* fixed a state problem where the current frame buffer was not reset to the correct value at the end of `createMultipleRenderTarget`.\r\n* fixed `shadowMap.customIsReadyFunction` to correctly check readiness when `ObjectRenderer.isReady` is called.\r\n* improved debugging by updating engine render pass names when `ObjectRenderer.name` is updated\r\n",

Also, uses array to store numbers would result in at least a 8-bytes double pre spec, and likely 24-bytes “heap number” in some chrome v8.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nPre-allocate buffers as TypedArray, from the loop below we can know that the size of linesIndices should be exactly 2x the size of this.indexCount (aligned down to 3 elements). This can also eliminate the overhead of scanning the buffer in engine._normalizeIndexData.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nForum post: <https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/submesh-pre-allocate-buffers-for-getlinesindexbuffer/55585>",

The texture management code remains in the latter classes, and in the case of the frame graph, is managed by the framework + the `FrameGraphGlowLayerTask` class.\r\n\r\nThe `GlowLayer` class is implemented through the `ThinGlowLayer` class (by composition, not inheritance, since it already inherits from the `EffectLayer` class). This means that `EffectLayer` now takes a `ThinEffectLayer` pointer in its constructor, and if it's not provided (as in the case of the highlight layer, which I haven't yet moved to the new architecture, or from existing user code), creates a `ThinEffectLayer` internally.\r\n\r\nWhen a `ThinEffectLayer` pointer is not passed to the `EffectLayer` constructor, this means that part of the code (all the “abstract” methods) is implemented by the class that inherits from `EffectLayer`: this is why the `EffectLayer` constructor binds these methods to the corresponding methods of the `ThinEffectLayer` it has created. When a pointer is passed to the constructor, this means that the methods are implemented in `ThinXXXLayer` (`ThinGlowLayer` for the glow layer), and the implementation of `EffectLayer`'s abstract methods in `XXXLayer` is simply transferred to `ThinXXXLayer` (see `ThinGlowLayer` implementation).\r\n\r\nIn this way, there is no duplication of code: everything (except the texture management code) is implemented in `ThinEffectLayer` and `ThinGlowLayer` and reused in `EffectLayer`, `GlowLayer` and `FrameGraphGlowLayerTask` (the latter class uses `ThinGlowLayer` directly).\r\n\r\nOther changes in this PR:\r\n* I've moved the management of the \"dependencies\" input to the `NodeRenderGraphBlock`, to centralize the code.\r\n* I've added a `dependencies` property to `FrameGraphTask` and removed `useTexture` from `FrameGraphRenderPass`. It makes more sense this way, and is easier to manage.\r\n",

Expected behavior is that all nodes are checked for export using `shouldExportNode()`, regardless of whether parent is being exported or not, but we missed this in https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/15869. \r\n\r\nNow children add themselves to their parent instead of parents tracking and adding their children. This helps address a weird situation where a child node is skipped, so its parent needs to add the indices of several grandchildren instead of just the child’s index (which is null anyway). The new `parentNodeChildren` parameter also helps with accessing the glTF root node list, in the case where a root node is skipped but has children that should be reparented to the root.\r\n\r\nAlso factored out the creation of the glTF nodes into _createNodeAsync() so that we can early return a null (meaning skipped) node and still process its children afterwards in _exportNodeAsync().",

Some light reading indicated that some JS engines will optimize Arrays that only contain booleans to use 1 bit per boolean, but this isn't what I saw happening when taking a few heap snapshots in Chrome (rather, I saw a ~5mb Array for a model with ~1.3M indices). Perf is pretty much identical between this `BitArray` and a normal `Array` of `boolean`s, until you have 100,000,000+ entries, in which case the `BitArray` is orders of magnitude faster. Not sure we'll ever have a use case this big, so maybe irrelevant, but good to know its now slower.",

This PR factors out common methods and fields of DracoCompression in preparation to be reused for Draco encoding.\r\n\r\n- DracoDecoder: new class to supersede DracoCompression. Manages own `Default` instance and static `DefaultConfiguration`. \r\n- DracoCodec: new base class for Draco. Contains common methods and fields related to Draco module consumption, workers setup, and managing `Default` and `DefaultConfiguration`.\r\n- DracoCompression: deprecated in favor of DracoDecoder. Backwards compat is maintained. While it inherits from DracoDecoder, it maintains its own separate `Default` and `DefaultConfiguration`.\r\n",

                "description": "The main change in this PR is to allow the environment texture and the skybox to be configured separately (this has come up multiple times, including in the [forum](https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/babylon-viewer-v2/54317/37). To try to keep this simple, `Viewer.loadEnvironment` now has an options object where you can specify whether the \"environment\" should be used for lighting or skybox or both. On the html element level, the `environment` attribute behaves the same as before (sets both the env texture and the skybox), but there are also now `environment-lighting` and `environment-skybox` attributes if you want to set them separately. This makes `environment` essentially a shorthand, somewhat like `padding` relative to `padding-top`, `padding-bottom`, etc.\r\n\r\nThe other changes included in this PR are:\r\n- Adding a reset camera button (so that discovering double click/tap is not required). This change was based on feedback from @PatrickRyanMS.\r\n- If animation is playing, pause it when activating a hotspot (e.g. moving the camera to a pose associated with the hotspot). Without this, a `surface` type hotspot will almost certainly have moved by the time the camera finishes its interpolation. This change was based on feedback from @PatrickRyanMS.\r\n- Update the icons to use svg from https://iconcloud.design. This change was based on feedback from @PatrickRyanMS.\r\n- Mark various internal members as `@internal` so they don't show up in the API docs.",

I found though that this doesn't work in some browsers, in that it just shows the hidden option. I tried a new approach here that just programmatically clears the selected value after it changes, which works on all browsers except chromium (Chrome/Edge) on Mac, where the only thing that doesn't work correctly is that it shows a check mark by the first item when there is no selected value. I will probably need to replace the use of <select> with a custom dropdown, but that will come later. For now, this is still an improvement.",

So, I implemented an \"execute\" task instead, that let's you run any function in any place of a frame graph. In this function, you can dispatch a compute shader, or do any kind of processing.\r\n\r\nNote that it's still possible to implement a compute pass in the future, if we think it can be beneficial.\r\n\r\nYou will see I added a \"dependencies\" input to most of the render graph blocks, so that it's possible to inject the execute task anywhere in the graph (the execute output can be connected to these dependencies input):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79569eda-afa1-4d07-bb4a-74398b1f5a21)\r\n",

Forcing the return type fixes the issue with the signature.\n\nTo fully test that I have added the signature to our es6 test compile step.",

                "description": "This PR changes fundamentally how the Babylon serializer to GLTF works. It changes the way the serializer handles left hand to right hand conversion.\r\n\r\n## Left hand to Right hand conversion\r\n\r\nWe no longer set mesh nodes with a negative scaling to handle left vs right hand conversion. We instead change every single vertex information when needed (normal, positions, and tangents) if the mesh was created in a left handed scene. We do the same for animation data and node transforms.\r\n\r\nThis should help decrease the file size of the exported glTF by removing the need for a root node to convert handedness, essentially reverting https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/13909.  \r\n\r\n## Cameras and Lights \r\n\r\nWe now collapse cameras and lights with their transform nodes that are added by the Babylon importer. The goal is for the scene to be able to roundtrip without infinitely expanding.\r\n\r\n## Preserve vertex data\r\n\r\nWe now avoid as much as possible changing the type of vertex data. If the Babylon scene is holding vertex data using a particular type we will avoid at all cost converting it to float or to any other type. We might apply transformations to the data (such as left to right hand system conversion) but those modifications will be done in place, avoiding as much as possible creating a new buffer. \r\n\r\nWe also allow meshes that share the same geometry to point to the same accessors in the generated GLTF, se we no longer do any buffer duplication.\r\n\r\nThis should help significantly decrease some glTF file sizes on roundtrip, as we no longer make copies of buffers nor needlessly convert smaller buffer types to float buffers.\r\n\r\n## Forum issues\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a couple of bugs from the forum: \r\n\r\n[Wrong flipping of animated cameras](https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/gltfexport-flipped-camera/45986/10)\r\n[Inconsistent transform serialization](https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/inconsistent-gltf-exports-between-babylon-5-and-babylon-6/45216)\r\n[Instances exporting as separate meshes](https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/how-to-get-instances-exported-when-instantiating-hierarchy-from-assetcontainer/41007/5?u=arraybuffer) and https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/issues/14056",

                "description": "## Background\r\n\r\nCurrently in BoundingBoxRenderer, it renders in a loop, calling `engine.drawElementsType` for each bounding box in `renderList`, making every bounding box 1 or 2 [draw call](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/featuresDeepDive/scene/optimize_your_scene/#reducing-draw-calls).\r\nSince it renders on web, it would suffer the same performance issue like meshes when draw calls increases.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nSince only the `worldMatrix` changes for different bounding boxes, it should benefit from instancing, like [thin instances](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/featuresDeepDive/mesh/copies/thinInstances) for meshes.\r\n\r\n1. Allocate buffers for instancing.\r\n2. Loop renderList and fill buffers.\r\n3. Copy buffers to gpu.\r\n4. Render instanced.\r\n\r\nWith instancing the draw call needed for each BoundingBoxRenderer could be reduced to 1 or 2 (in case `this.showBackLines` enabled)\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n<https://playground.babylonjs.com/#37HN68#14>\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\nSince there are very few[1] vertex needed, and there is already [`vectorsWorld`](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/73ab4d666c0506a5fe551ce852a23e0e8ec0d15a/packages/dev/core/src/Culling/boundingBox.ts#L43) in `BoundingBox`, which [updates](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/73ab4d666c0506a5fe551ce852a23e0e8ec0d15a/packages/dev/core/src/Culling/boundingBox.ts#L166) every time world matrix updates, the computation of matrices can be skipped, and reuse computation result of `vectorsWorld` to rebuild vertex buffer every time it renders. In this case `_indexBuffer` needs to be reconstructed is count of bounding box mismatches.\r\n\r\n[1]: 24 points in case of `CreateBoxVertexData`, or 8 points if constructed manually, since uvs and normals are not needed for rendering as lines\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\n1. It's disabled by default for backwards compatibility.\r\n2. It could result in a difference in rendering result if\r\n`showBackLines` enabled, because drawing the black/white part of each box one after the other can be different from drawing the black part of all boxes and then the white part.\r\n3. Events of `onBeforeBoxRenderingObservable` and `onAfterBoxRenderingObservable` would only be triggered once\r\nfor one rendering, instead of once every bounding box. Events would be triggered with a dummy box to keep backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nForum post: <https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/batched-or-instanced-boundingboxrenderer/54977>",

This change fixes the issue by calling `Engine._sharedInit` with the WebGL rendering context's canvas.\r\n\r\nNote that the WebGL rendering context's canvas may be an `OffscreenCanvas` and its type is cast to `HTMLCanvasElement` for the call to `Engine._sharedInit` because it would be a large change to make `AbstractEngine._renderingCanvas` support both types.

                "description": "Prior to this change, it was difficult (in some scenarios nearly impossible) to pan the camera when the camera is close to a part of the mesh. This PR has a couple of related changes to help with this situation:\r\n\r\n1. The panning sensitivity and speed are now relative to the camera's distance from its target (e.g. the ArcRotateCamera's radius). This is done directly in the Viewer, rather than trying to make this an optional behavior of the ArcRotateCamera itself.\r\n2. The viewer now directly handles double click/tap and does a pick operation. If it hits a model mesh, then it updates the camera target. If not, it resets the camera pose (previously the behavior of double click/tap always).\r\n\r\nThis means you can zoom in on part of the mesh, double click/tap to make it the new target, and then easily rotate or pan the camera around that part of the mesh.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/290d76cb-3d42-45e6-8eec-cf142d5c81eb\r\n\r\nThe Viewer's new `pick` function is exposed through the viewer details, and this change also includes a new `CreateHotSpotQueryForPickingInfo` function. These will be used in conjunction by tooling to create hotspots in the future.",

I haven't changed the number of samples yet but we should be able to lower them from what they currently are.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n1. Using importance sampling with the CDF maps should be an option for prefiltering IBL's as well.\r\n2. Should using these CDF maps be a separate option and not directly replace the existing filtering? The main downside is that it requires the CDF maps to be generated first. After that, the speed/quality should always be a win.\r\n3. I haven't modified the WebGPU irradiance function yet because it doesn't seem to be used. What I mean is that, when I modify the `irradiance()` function in the glsl shaders, it seems to affect the WebGPU rendering as well. I really don't understand why.\r\n4.

The interpolation factor was pulled from the `restoreStateInterpolationFactor` property though, which is confusing because it means by default `interpolateTo` won't actually interpolate (since `restoreStateInterpolationFactor` is 0 by default for back compat). This change adds an optional `interpolationFactor` parameter to `interpolateTo` so that you can specify the interpolation factor directly. If it is not provided, it will default to `restoreStateInterpolationFactor` if it is non-zero, otherwise it will default to a reasonable constant value.",

This \"controller callback\" is kind of a new pattern for glTF extensions using the newish options support. Another way to do this would be to have a higher level callback option for when a specific loader plugin is created (analogous to `OnPluginActivatedObservable`) and when a specific glTF extension is created (analogous to `onExtensionLoadedObservable`) and use the extension instance directly. I don't really like this because to me it seems like a complex API (in the same way the static observables are complex and often a sticking point for users). Another option yet would be to have some kind of extensible output object in the same way options are an extensible input object. For example, `AssetContainer` could have an `extras` property (or something like that) where the underlying `AssetExtras` type could be extended by loader plugins and glTF extensions. Then you might do something like (`const variants = assetContainer.extras.materialVariants` and `assetContainer.extras.selectedMaterialVariant = someVariant`). That would be a bigger change though, and I'm not sure how we would make something like this work across the different loader functions. I think it could make sense for `loadAssetContainerAsync`, but maybe not the other loader functions. Thoughts @bghgary?\r\n- Viewer uses the \"controller\" returned by `KHR_materials_variants` to expose a simple material variants API.\r\n- Viewer element exposes material variants and also provides default UI (variant selection).\r\n- A bit of refactoring in the viewer element to make it easy to have any combination of toolbar controls (animation, material variants, hotspots) and put a vertical separator between each one.",

                "description": "In certain cases dev wish to precompile shaders on a different canvas, outside of the context of a babylon engine.\r\nThis can accelerate future shader compilations as the browser itself caches shaders (tested on both chrome and safari).\r\n\r\nSo a pipeline can be created where:\r\n1. Pipeline is generated first, without any Babylon engine\r\n2. babylon engine is created\r\n3. Pipeline is (re)created with the same shader, resulting in a much faster shader compilation.\r\n\r\nIf step 1 can be done in parallel to step 2, this can speed up the loading process (for example if the package using in step 2 is large enough to be slow to download).\r\n\r\nHowever, so far there was no support for parallel precompilation as this information comes from the engine. as there is no engine, there is no flag set.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. If parallel compilation can be enabled, it is enabled, while maintaining the current behavior in thinEngine\r\n2. WebGL preprocessor is not included per default and not async loaded, as it is the default one and is probably the one mostly used. This saves one async import\r\n3. A new flag was added when generating the pipeline - if `waitForIsReady` is set to true, the promise will resolve when the pipeline is ready,a s opposed to right after the shader was compiled.\r\n\r\nReasoning behind using setInterval - this code is only used for shader precompilation by external packages (and not by babylon internals). to avoid addding unneeded code to this package, I decided to use a standard browser feature.\r\n\r\nThough this PG will only work locally (due to non-exported internal function) this si the PG i have used to test the functionality - #8Z0MKW#104 . this is for future reference, mainly for me.",

Prepare the playground to a full snapshot deployment and testing.\n\nThe next steps (after this is merged) are:\n\n1. Build the playground as part of the standard CI\n2. Deploy this to a snapshot directory so we can test the actual playground (and not only the default playground with CDN snapshots)\n3. Run the playground tests as part of this CI step. Fail if the playground doesn't work correctly.\n\nNote that I opted-out of snapshot testing for the actual website. Mainly because of different rendering cross OSes AND the fact that we have a constant version changing, which will require either not rendering this part or ignoring a lot of pixel changes, which will render snapshot testing useless.\n",

                "description": "I've made a few changes so that I can create an empty `RenderTargetWrapper` and “connect” the render textures + depth texture later:\r\n* New `dontCreateTextures` options in `IMultiRenderTargetOptions`. This way, `Engine.createMultipleRenderTarget` will not create textures (color/depth).\r\n* New `createMSAATexture` options in `InternalTextureCreationOptions`. This option allows `Engine._createInternalTexture` to immediately create the MSAA texture (`WebGLRenderBuffer` in WebGL) associated with the internal texture. For the moment, these textures are only created when you call `updateRenderTargetTextureSampleCount` or `updateMultipleRenderTargetTextureSampleCount`, in conjunction with a `RenderTargetWrapper`. Note that this option is not used in WebGPU, as this is already the way it works now.\r\n* New setter `RenderTargetWrapper.depthStencilTexture` (we already have a getter), to be able to define the depth/stencil texture of a `RenderTargetWrapper` from an existing texture.\r\n* `Engine._createInternalTexture` is now able to create a depth/stencil texture. Previously, you could only create one by calling `Engine._createDepthStencilTexture`, and it was automatically associated with a `RenderTargetWrapper`.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, it's easy to create all color/depth textures by calling `Engine._createInternalTexture`, and combine them as you wish in a `RenderTargetWrapper` to create a render target (this is what a frame graph render pass does - see the new `FrameGraphRenderTarget` class).\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n* I've put `IsDepthTexture`, `GetTypeForDepthTexture` and `HasStencilAspect` in `internalTexture.ts`. I don't know if there's a better place... I tried to put them in `Misc/textureTools.ts` first, but there was a problem with the imports because I need to use these functions in `thinEngine.ts`.\r\n* I removed the functions in `FrameGraph.ts` that only redirected to the corresponding functions in `FrameGraphTextureManager`.\r\n* The NRG `Clear` block can now clear a color and depth texture at the same time.",

TypeScript 5.5+ has this property and type, so I started trying to update our TypeScript version. However I ran into some problems with deprecated TypeScript APIs used for the path transformation stuff in the build. I tried to fix it (based on some input from the TypeScript team!), but I definitely broke it. So I'm creating a draft PR as a starting point for getting TypeScript updated.",

                "description": "This PR includes a few small bug fixes:\r\n1. `computeMaxExtents` changes the current animation frame to do its calculations, but it doesn't restore the original value. This was causing the Viewer to start at the wrong animation frame when first starting an animation and when switching animations. I think it's best to fix this in the `computeMaxExtents` function so it leaves the animation in the state it found it in.\r\n2. When switching animations, we reset to the first animation frame, and we need to fire one onAnimationProgressChanged event so the animation timeline properly syncs to the animation state.\r\n3. The viewer HTML element should set overflow to hidden by default, otherwise if a child annotation is pulled out of view (e.g. through an animation or panning the camera) it will overflow and show scroll bars. Instead we just want the annotation to go out of view along with the model.",

The reason why is because [passing in `invertY` of true doesn't actually work for compressed textures](https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/make-inverty-flag-more-consistent-across-different-texture-loading-scenarios/52751).

This is ref counted, because I intend to use the same mechanism for other scenarios, such as when the viewer is visible but nothing is changing.\r\n- In the `createViewerForCanvas` function, use `IntersectionObserver` to detect when the viewer canvas is not in the browser viewport and suspend rendering.\r\n- Update the test app to be able to toggle on/off extra blank content before/after the <babylon-viewer> element to make it easy to test the outside of viewport scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecac125c-3b8e-4196-b01d-aa074fbb0417\r\n\r\n",

This way, I can use `ObjectRenderer` in the frame graph, as the texture management part of `RenderTargetTexture` is of no use.\r\n\r\nFirstly, `ObjectRenderer` can be changed to whatever name suits you :)\r\n\r\nSecondly, the PR should be a non-breaking change (if it is, it's a bug!), which is why:\r\n* I have two functions `prepareRenderList` and `initRender` that you have to call one after the other. I'd have preferred to call `prepareRenderList` inside `initRender` and have only the latter method public, but in the existing `RenderTargetTexture` function there's notification of the `onBeforeBindObservable` observable between these two blocks of code, and it doesn't make sense to have this observable in the `ObjectRenderer` class (because this class isn't concerned with texture management).\r\n* There's a `skipOnAfterRenderObservable` parameter to the `ObjectRenderer.render` method, so as not to notify the `onAfterRenderObservable` at the end of `ObjectRenderer.render`. This is because in `RenderTargetTexture`, this observable is notified in the `Engine.unBindFramebuffer` callback: notifying it at the end of `ObjectRenderer.render` would have been a breaking change.\r\n\r\nThe expected usage is as follows (if you use the class directly - it's hidden from you if you use `RenderTargetTexture`):\r\n* call `prepareRenderList()` (optional, you can avoid this call if you know that `renderList` is up to date)\r\n* call `initRender(viewportWidth, viewportHeight)`.\r\n* call `render(layerOrFaceIndex)` as many times as necessary (for a cube texture, you'll want to call it 6 times, each time linking the right face of the cube to the output texture)\r\n* call `finishRender()`.\r\n\r\nOnce again, the names of these methods can be changed!",

The reason is that vite requires the moduled scss files to be called \".module.scss\" and we called them. \".modules.scss\". In webpack it is configurable.\r\n* as the viewer renders the canvas in a shadow dom, adding the inspector to the canvas as its parent won't work - the css rules will nto be applied there. Therefore it is needed to add it to an inspector host. it defaults to body if not provided, but the body needs to be styled correctly in order for that to work. The viewer has another div element that is stretched on the screen, which is used as the host.\r\n* The inspector is async-loaded.\r\n* All require keywords were removed from the source. it is fine with webpack, but not with vite nor rollup\r\n\r\nThese changes actually allow the inspector to be released as a standalone es6 module (i.e. - not bundled). As this can be considered a breaking change I did not include it in this PR. we can discuss it in the future. for now no change was made to break anything.\r\n\r\n---\r\nEDIT from @ryantrem:\r\n- After trying for a bit I wasn't able to get this to work with the viewer distribution bundle, so I removed the `showInspector` function from the viewer element.\r\n- However, I kept the \"show inspector\" button in the viewer test app, which directly invokes the inspector (so we can both test inspector with the viewer and use it in local development).\r\n- I made some small changes to Inspector to make it work with shadow doms.\r\n\r\nWe can circle back to the inspector integration later and try to get it included as a feature, particularly if we think it is important to have it work with the viewer distribution bundle. At least now with these changes if both the viewer and the inspector are consumed by an app being build/bundled, inspector will work with the viewer.",

                "description": "This change makes it possible to programmatically \"focus on\" a hotspot. The camera target is determined by querying the hotspot. Additionally, each hotspot can optionally have additional explicit camera pose data (alpha/beta/radius) associated with it. When focusing on a hotspot, the calculated camera target is always used, and the alpha/beta/radius is used if it is provided.\r\n\r\nSince hotspot data has become a bit more complex (with optional camera data), and since we expect other types of hotspots in the future (like static world space locations), I switched from a custom parsed format to it just being a JSON string. I think this is much more scalable, plus people will already be familiar with JSON, so no need to learn a bespoke way of encoding structured data in a string.\r\n\r\nHotspots are specified like this:\r\n```html\r\n<babylon-viewer\r\n    source=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BabylonJS/Assets/master/meshes/ufo.glb\"\r\n    hotspots='{\r\n        \"hotspot 1\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"surface\",\r\n            \"meshIndex\": 1,\r\n            \"pointIndex\": [228, 113, 111],\r\n            \"barycentric\": [0.217, 0.341, 0.442],\r\n            \"cameraOrbit\": [1.085, 1.417, 0.518]\r\n        },\r\n    }'\r\n>\r\n</babylon-viewer>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo focus on a hotspot, you can call `focusHotSpot` on the viewer element:\r\n```js\r\ndocument.querySelector('babylon-viewer').focusHotSpot('hotspot 1');\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make this a good experience, the camera pose is interpolated. To make this possible, I did a small refactor in `ArcRotateCamera` to add an `interpolateTo` function that does the same thing `ArcRotateCamera` already did when restoring the saved state, it's just now possible to interpolate to any goal state rather than only the stored state.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes default UI to activate a defined hotspot (by activate, I mean invoke `focusOnHotspot`). Since the camera pose can be changed by user interactions, there is no concept of an \"selected\" hotspot, rather just the idea that you can one-off activate them. This is what the experience looks like:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9c4c1ef-31c4-4264-9da1-49d2b7f853a5\r\n\r\nThe new hotspot activation button is only displayed if there are hotspots defined in the `<babylon-viewer>`. If there are hotspots but no animations, then just the hotspot button is displayed in the center of the screen. We can iterate on UX design more later.\r\n\r\nOther notes for this PR:\r\n- Since it is now easy to interpolate the camera pose, it also interpolates when changing the selected animation (since the camera pose is updated based on the first frame of each animation).\r\n- There was a bug in `GetHotSpotToRef` such that it returned the hotspot position in local space instead of world space (even though it was documented as returning the position in world space), so I fixed this. As such, when the viewer calculates the screen space position via `ProjectToRef`, it now just passes the identity matrix since the position is already in world space.\r\n",

The styling can be customized (via CSS variables for things like color or the progress-bar part for things like height, border radius, etc.) or completely replaced with custom UI (via the progress-bar slot). For cases where we don't know the size of the download, it is a simple indeterminate progress bar.\r\n\r\nCurrently this is only for model source download, it does not take into account environment texture download. I think we should probably bring this in as well, but it requires more changes to core.

Notes on this:\r\n- Tone mapping is set to KHR PBR Neutral by default.\r\n- Tone mapping, contrast, and exposure are not applied to the skybox.\r\n- When these attributes are explicitly set, they are re-applied when a new model is loaded. If they are not set, then the current property value is retained (similar behavior as some other attributes).\r\n\r\nThis change includes a few other small fixes as well:\r\n- Enable transparency as coverage by default.\r\n- Remove the outline from the canvas (otherwise it is clicked it shows a black outline).",

This allows me to apply the shadows only to diffuse reflections and rough specular and not to things like emission.\r\n\r\nSome current issues:\r\n1. We always need to add the plugin to the material before it's used for rendering. However, in WebGPU, I get errors while trying to add the plugin to material in the callback of ImportMesh. `The plugin \"IBLShadowsPluginMaterial\" can't be added to the material \"BoomBox_Mat\" because this material has already been used for rendering!` #8R5SSE#293",

[(Repro)](https://playground.babylonjs.com/#SF2UOQ) _- make sure to have a gamepad attached_\r\n\r\n### What Should Happen\r\n\r\nPerformance should not be impacted by a gamepad being connected.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nRemove the call to [`_checkGamepadStatus()` in `gamepadSceneComponent.ts`](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/packages/dev/core/src/Gamepads/gamepadSceneComponent.ts#L138). The call to [`_checkGamepadStatus()` in `gamepadManager._startMonitoringGamepads()`](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/packages/dev/core/src/Gamepads/gamepadManager.ts#L194) should be enough to kick off a recursive loop that ensures it is called just once per frame.\r\n\r\nRel: https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/13798 (might have unintentionally triggered this?)",

                "description": "Sorry, monster PR!\r\n\r\n**Warning**: Everything is experimental at this stage! Everything may/will change before version 8.0 is released, so be warned that your code may break without notice if you use this new feature.\r\n\r\n----\r\n<h3>Reviewing the PR</h3>\r\n\r\nThere's still a lot to do, but I had to deliver a first version before continuing, so that the existing code could be reviewed and team members could work on extending the framework.\r\n\r\nAs the PR has over 18,000 changes, I think I should point out the most important code to review:\r\n* I had to make a number of changes in the core engine to properly handle multiple rendering targets. These are the files under `Engines/`.\r\n* The frame graph framework:\r\n  * everything in the `FrameGraph/` directory\r\n  * the two files under `packages/dev/gui/src/2D/FrameGraph/` and `packages/gui/src/2D/advancedDynamicTexture.ts`.\r\n* The new architecture of post-process classes:\r\n  * The files `PostProcesses/ThinXXXPostProcess.ts` and `PostProcesses/ThinXXXEffect.ts` implement the core of post-processes / rendering effects. Note that only a few post-processes / rendering effects have been ported to the new architecture for the time being.\r\n  * `EffectWrapper` has been extended to be the base class used by the new `ThinXXX` classes: `Materials/effectRenderer.ts`.\r\n\r\nApart from these files, there have been many changes in the configuration files to support the new NRGE (Node Render Graph Editor). Of course, there's also the NRGE itself (`packages/tools/nodeRenderGraphEditor/`) if you'd like to take a look!\r\n\r\n----\r\n<h3>Quick instructions to get started</h3>\r\n\r\nTo use a frame graph to render a scene, you need... :\r\n* set `scene.frameGraph` to the frame graph\r\n* set `scene.useFrameGraph = true`.\r\n* When a frame graph is used, it will use the new `scene.customRenderFunction` to render the scene.\r\n  * This means that a lot of code is no longer executed (`scene._evaluateActiveMeshes`, `scene._renderForCamera`, many observables are no longer notified, etc).\r\n  * A number of features are currently broken because of this (frozen meshes, snapshot rendering, and others). We'll be fixing this over the coming months.\r\n* **Important**: also set `scene.cameraToUseForPointers` to a proper camera!\r\n  * There is no longer a “current active camera” when using the frame graph for rendering, which would last for the duration of `scene.render` and is normally used as the “camera to use for pointers” (`scene.activeCamera` is still used - a lot of code depends on it - but only when running `RenderTargetTexture.render`).\r\n\r\nYou can create a frame graph in 3 ways:\r\n* using the `FrameGraphXXX` classes: http://localhost:1338/#2VHZFE#4\r\n* by importing a node render graph from NRGE: http://localhost:1338/#T6F4ZE#59 (the node render graph: http://localhost:1344/#PSA9PS#42)\r\n* create it using the `NodeRenderGraphXXX` classes, by manually connecting the nodes => probably won't be used much\r\n\r\nNote that you can also use frame graphs without setting `scene.frameGraph` / `scene.useFrameGraph` parameters: you can simply call `FrameGraph.execute` yourself when you want a graph to be executed.\r\n\r\nIn [this example](http://localhost:1338/#C8Z7GS#47), a pass post-process is used to render the scene in a texture, which is then used by the frame graph to apply a number of effects (black and white, bloom effect, GUI).",

Once _pointerMoveEvent() added pointerId 6 to _activeTouchIds, then later when _pointerUpEvent() came along, it would find pointerId 6 in _activeTouchIds and pass the call along to scene.inputManager.\r\n\r\nNow note that scene.inputManager never heard about the pointer down event for pointerId 6, but it gets this pointer up event for it, so it decrements _totalPointersPressed.\r\n\r\nNow _totalPointersPressed can get to 0 before all of the pointerIds that it did get pointer down events for have been released with pointer up events.  \r\n\r\nBaseCameraPointersInput may be tracking one of those pointerIds as _pointA or _pointB, and if so, it will never get the pointer up event for that pointerId, and never clear _pointA or _pointB since upstream, scene.inputManager incorrectly ignored the pointer up event for that pointerId (since _totalPointersPressed was incorrectly 0 already).\r\n\r\nThe fix is to make scene.inputManager more carefully track pointerId down/up pairs, instead of assuming that it will always get matching events.  This is similar to the strategy that webDeviceInputSystem uses.  Now it will only process pointer up events whose pointerId was processed previously by a pointer down event.\r\n\r\nConfirmed that this fixes the current repro, and does not regress the bug reported [originally ](https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/pointer-capture-failing-for-babylon-pointer-observable-during-a-scroll-event/43253) which exposed this issue.  That was introduced by the code in _pointerMoveEvent() which would add a pointerId to the _activeTouchIds list even if its touch down had been ignored.  That set us up for the situation where the pointer up would then be processed at the webDeviceInputSystem layer even though the pointer down had not been.",

Since it is in the html layer, it relies on WebAPI to convert an arbitrary color string to a Babylon Color4. It is transparent by default. I also made one other small change to have the root div (`:host` in css) inherit all from the outer babylon-viewer element. I think this should be safe, and it lets you do things like this in CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbabylon-viewer {\r\n  background-image: url(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BabylonJS/Assets/master/textures/Checker_albedo.png\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCombining these two things together, with the default transparent `clear-color` you can get this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5310c258-94fa-4271-9b5d-c53749089ca7)\r\n",

However removing it also breaks other things. Specifically, we need to skip frustum culling (render all meshes) for WebGPU snapshot mode. So I'm adding this back explicitly (along with one other performancePriority related setting) for now. Also I updated the published.html test file to use jsdelivr instead of unpkg as it is faster and easier to use when testing.",

                "description": "This change mostly is about using the new `SnapshotRenderingHelper` to enable WebGPUEngine snapshot rendering mode. Unfortunately there are some mysteries with the perf impact, most notably, when I was testing all this on my MacBook two weeks ago, I was seeing the frame rate on my test model (20x20x20 cubes) go from ~60fps to ~95fps (on my 120hz display). Now, I am seeing ~58fps -> 66fps, even if I checkout the same branch from two weeks ago (not just the version that is using `SnapshotRenderingHelper`). I have no explanation for this. The only thing I can think of is that I installed a MacOS update since then. Behavior is the same in Chrome and Edge. With an even heavier model (25x25x25 cubes), I am seeing these results:\r\n\r\n### MacBook\r\n- WebGL: 45fps\r\n- WebGPU: 25fps\r\n- WebGPU w/snapshot: 27fps\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n- WebGL: 48fps\r\n- WebGPU: 40fps\r\n- WebGPU w/snapshot: 55fps\r\n\r\nSo snapshot rendering as is still improves perf for the viewer, but not as dramatically as when previously tested, and it's now worse than `Engine` (WebGL) on my MacBook, so it would be good to investigate more separately.\r\n\r\nI included a couple other small changes in this PR as well:\r\n- When ViewerElement parses the hotspots string, it splits on any amount of white space, not just a single white space (@CedricGuillemet).\r\n- I changed the default engine for the Viewer test app to be WebGPU for now.\r\n- Disabled the test hotspot in the Viewer test app by default since it kind of gets in the way when testing other models.\r\n- Added a published.html test file to make it easy to test the published viewer package.\r\n",

                "description": "OK folks!\r\n\r\nHere is the first attempt to remove one of our side effects while preserving our back compat.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell: \r\n- No change for UMD as everything is reexported from index.ts\r\n- For ES6, for users who were importing \"animatable.ts\": no change, side effects are still here and we still update the prototype\r\n- For the framework and for people who will not import from \"animatable.ts\", they will be able to pick and choose what they need from \"animatable.core\". In that mode the user will have to register scene._animate = SceneAnimate. I plan to create an additional InitAnimations(scene) that will do it. I will document it in a new page dedicated to all this new way of dealing with NO side effects.\r\n\r\nBut before going further,I have one question for @RaananW though:\r\n\r\n**If you look at the changes I did for mesh.ts, you can see that now I import \"BeginAnimation\". But does that ruin all the effort? Will that force the bundler to import Animation and Animatable?**\r\nhttps://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/15656/files#diff-ef2df1b096469b55aef42174260ffc963185b1b91ed5bf63f1941a2decb92e9bR4304\r\n\r\n\r\n",

My hope is that the readme.md will basically be the top level doc page for the viewer, and then we'll have more detailed doc pages plus the API documentation. This will be easier to setup after @RaananW merges the docs repo into the main BJS monorepo. For now I'm just updating the top level readme.md.\r\n\r\nThis change also adds photoStudio.env to an assets folder of the viewer package.\r\n\r\nLastly, this change removes the `\"sideEffects\": false` from the package.json. I found in various integrations that with this set, the custom element registration does not work since it in fact depends on side effects (effectively a module level call to `customElements.define`, which is the standard pattern for custom elements). I will talk with @RaananW more about this specific change.",

                "description": "The main change here is to improve camera framing via:\r\n1. Using the new `computeMaxExtents` helper from @bghgary to take into account animation. This significantly improves the framing for models with significant translation in animations. Note this also includes a small bug fix in `computeMaxExtents` where it did not handle the case of a mesh with no verts.\r\n2. When models have animations, set the selected `AnimationGroup` to frame 0. This ensures it is within the camera framing computed for the model + animation.\r\n3. Change the camera to looking down at a slight angle to the object.\r\n4. Reduce the framing scalar from 1.2 to 1.1 to fit a bit better.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple other Viewer fixes included in this PR as well:\r\n1. Remove the redundant `beginFrame` and `endFrame` calls. They are already called in `_renderLoop` and they mess up frame time calculations and break some behavior (like animating the camera back to its initial pose upon double click).\r\n2. If an async operation (like loading an environment or model) was correctly started while the viewer was not disposed, but then the viewer is disposed while the async operation is still running, the async operation should be aborted and throw and abort error rather than a disposed error. A disposed error is indicative of a programming error, which this is not. We need this to be accurate for consumers who need to be able to tell the difference between an unexpected error and an expected error.",

                "title": "Lighting and other Viewer improvements",
                "description": "This change includes a few improvements to the new Viewer:\r\n\r\n1. The conditions for a default light are improved (it now considers whether there is an environment, whether the model brings in its own lights, and the models materials).\r\n2. `ViewerDetails` is now publicly exposed from the viewer element. It used to only be available via the `viewerready` event, but this can cause challenges (particularly when using the viewer element in React) due to timing between different async operations (such as mounting and rendering a React component). Now a consumer can register for the event and also check if the viewer is already in a loaded state (via the `viewerDetails` property).\r\n3. The `environmenterror` and `modelerror` events are now `ErrorEvents` and include the error. This is useful to be able to check and see if the error is an abort error.\r\n4. Replaced abbreviated attributes with full names (e.g. `src` -> `source` and `env` -> `environment`). @bghgary convinced me as abbreviated names are not really used in new/modern WebAPI, but rather only in very old APIs.\r\n5. `Async` postfixes have been removed, since generally in JS APIs it is non-standard and these APIs are all new so we don't need to disambiguate them against legacy APIs that use callbacks.\r\n6. Switched from `Scalar.Clamp` to `Clamp`.\r\n\r\nIt also has a few changes not in the Viewer, but related:\r\n1. `STLFileLoader` imports `StandardMaterial`.\r\n2. `AnimationGroup` imports `Animatable`.\r\n3. `glTFLoader` imports `AnimationGroup` dynamically (to defer the cost until we know the model has animations).",

The main file is the one that will be tested. the async-size can grow with time, and it is expected that the main size will decrease with time the more async will grow.\n\nThis PR also adds the ability to define the flags for testing these packages as part of the repository. For example, to increase the error threshold, edit the file `flags.json` in `./.build/` (which is empty at the momoent) as set it to:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"errorThreshold\": 1.2\n}\n```\n\nThis will allow a threshold of 20% instead of the default 10%.\n\nTo add another test case, simply add a new .ts file in the ./src/ folder of /packages/tools/tests\nThe initial fileSize will be set but not inspected.",

                "description": "This PR has a number of fixes related to the new viewer, mostly in response to usages of the new viewer in different contexts.\r\n\r\n1. The viewer html element previously exposed the underlying viewer object as a property. However, the underlying viewer is created asynchronously depending on various factors (whether or not the element is in the DOM, asynchrony of the Lit update/render sequence, and now also additional asynchrony for Babylon engine instantiation). This makes it quite hard to use, so I've replaced the property with an event (`viewerready`) that fires every time a viewer instantiation has completed.\r\n1. Added events for environment change and error.\r\n1. Made viewer API more consistent for loading/resetting the environment/model.\r\n1. Enabled Lit property \"reflection\" (e.g. changing the property will \"reflect\" back to the attribute, which allows for CSS styling based on attribute values).\r\n1. Added an \"engine\" attribute/property that can be undefined (we make the best choice of engine for you based on implementation details) or \"WebGL\" or \"WebGPU\", and updated aspects of the code to be async to account for the fact that WebGPUEngine creation is asynchronous (requires a call to `initAsync`). However, I am leaving out \"WebGPU\" for now because there are a number of problems due to missing dependencies that come from side effects. Some of these looked easy to fix (e.g. they are already in an async context), and some of them not so easy. @deltakosh not sure if this is the expected state of things for WebGPUEngine.\r\n1. Changed MSFT_audio_emitter to import `audioSceneComponent` (it can't work without this). @bghgary \r\n1. Fixed a bug in weightedsound where if pause was called when not playing, then play will try to index into the sounds array with an undefined index value. @docEdub ",

One of the examples I used was `Scalar`. @deltakosh started to make the migration to functions in https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/commit/74c4c4740dde6488a8dd46d2a50917a6cf83a06f.\r\n\r\nThis PR completes the migration from static methods on `Scalar` to functions. I've updated all usage throughout the framework, and marked the original class as deprecated, though I have not removed it for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nIt also renames the functions that are named using pascal case to camel case in order to follow the correct convention. Again, they were not removed for backward compatibility but have been marked as deprecated.\r\n\r\nOne notable change is that I omitted the `Scalar.Log2` and `Scalar.Sign` method. This is because `Math.log2` and `Math.sign` can be used instead, which should be faster since it is a native function.\r\n\r\nUsing functions should speed up performance and reduce bundle size.\r\n\r\nIf pascal case is desired for the function names, I'm flexible and can make the change in a minute so no worries there.",

                "title": "Async/dynamic loader factories",
                "description": "TLDR; the net effect of this change for the alpha Viewer is that it brings the **core bundle size down from ~1.5mb to ~1.15mb**. Anything else needed to load any type of supported file or glTF extension can be downloaded as a separate chunk on demand.\r\n\r\nThis is an alternative approach to #15492. Overall I think this one is much better. This is much more similar to what I originally wanted to do, but I was a bit stuck on the fact that the legacy loader functions synchronously returned the plugin instance. After talking with @sebavan though, we both agreed that since the user must explicitly opt into loaders anyway, it would be ok to have a new opt-in path for the dynamic loaders, and in this case, they give up the old functionality of having a plugin instance being synchronously returned from the legacy loader functions. So now with this change you can simply change:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport \"@babylonjs/loaders/OBJ/objFileLoader\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n```ts\r\nimport { registerOBJLoader } from \"@babylonjs/loaders/OBJ/objFileLoader.dynamic\";\r\nregisterOBJLoader();\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the new dynamic loaders could have worked via side effect just like the static ones, but we are trying to move away from side effects so I opted to require a function to be called.\r\n\r\nWhen the dynamic loaders are used, you can still call the legacy loader functions, but they will return null instead of a plugin instance (the contract already allowed for the possibility of null being returned).\r\n\r\nWith this approach, `objFileLoader.dynamic` is 288 bytes minified, so very low overhead to be able to load the obj loader dynamically only when you actually try to load an obj file.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I've also now added the other loaders, and for glTF (2.0), extension factories can also now be async, which means they can also use dynamic imports. This also introduces the concept of a glTF loader extension either being associated with a glTF extension or not. If it is, then it is only instantiated if the extension is used. So in the case of dynamic imports, it will only be downloaded when needed. To maintain back compat, this requires splitting each existing extension file into at least two files - one that just has the implementation but not the side effect registration, and one for the side effect registration for back compat. For the one extension that I'm showing this pattern, I actually split it into three, where the third is the dynamic import async factory. If we don't want to split every extension into 3 files (rather just 2), then we could just mash all the factory registrations into a single dynamic.ts file. However, this would mean consumers could not choose to only include a subset of glTF extensions in their bundle chunks, so my personal preference is to just have 3 files. Future extensions could forego the old static registration pattern and only support dynamic registration, which would then mean 2 files per extension.",

I've removed this.\r\n* There were some async issues with multiple calls to setIblTexture that would prevent the IBL from being initialized correctly.\r\n  *  e.g. https://playground.babylonjs.com//#8R5SSE#211",

                "description": "I recently added the default toolbar for animation controls in the alpha Viewer. I tested it on Chrome/Edge/Safari/Firefox on MacOS as well as Safari on iOS and Chrome on Android. However it turns out that only on Windows, the popup for a `select` is stylable, and so it did not render correctly since the default Viewer styling first removes all default styling for `select`s and then adds back custom styling. This change adds additional custom styling to the `option`s of the `select`s.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d288be66-ce55-481d-af39-3ac486cf403f)\r\n",

When the viewer is taking up the full space of the parent, it's not visible, so I missed it previously. I just changed it to use a ternary operator and substitute empty string when there is no animation.",

                "description": "This is a first pass at adding animation state, logic, and default UI to the viewer alpha. Addresses #15470 \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c9bedc1-2e01-417d-aa9e-ce5c8b9d18b7\r\n\r\nAs seen above, this includes:\r\n- Animation toolbar if there are any animations (otherwise it is not shown)\r\n- Drop down of animations if there are more than one (otherwise it is not shown)\r\n- Play/pause button\r\n- Animation timeline/progress (shows current state and can be manually scrubbed)\r\n- Drop down to select animation speed (0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x)\r\n- Camera auto rotation timeout is reset any time an animation runs (including scrubbing)\r\n\r\nThis change adds new state and logic to the Viewer layer to deal with animations, and exposes some state and observables.\r\n\r\nIt also changes the ViewerElement (DOM) layer significantly because I moved it to use [Lit](https://lit.dev/). This was the plan from the beginning, once we had complex enough UI requirements to make it useful. Lit builds on top of Web Components Custom Elements and provides React-like functionality (properties, state, auto attributes, efficient batched updates, etc.). It does add about 15k to the bundle, but also significantly simplifies the custom element implementation. It is a popular library commonly used when implementing custom elements. Another benefit of Lit is that it uses html/css template literals (e.g. ```html`<div>...</div>` ```), and there are bundler plugins to minify these strings, which ultimately helps offset the size impact of bringing in Lit in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe ViewerElement includes the following changes:\r\n- Leverages Lit as mentioned above\r\n- Binds state and props to the Viewer layer\r\n- Publicly exposes some new attributes, properties, functions, and events dealing with animation\r\n- Provides default UI for controlling animations (a fair bit of this was lifted from the legacy viewer, but converted from handlebars syntax to template literal syntax)\r\n  -  I also did some accessibility testing for keyboard navigation, screen reader, and contrast ratio using Accessibility Insights and Lighthouse.\r\n- Introduces a few custom CSS variables for simple customization (e.g. changing the color of the toolbar)\r\n- Introduces the toolbar as a *part* for moderate customization (e.g. changing the style of the toolbar to change its size, position, etc.)\r\n- Introduces the toolbar within a *slot* for total customization (e.g. completely replace it with your own UI, where your own UI is bound to the public properties, events, and functions related to animation)\r\n\r\nThe bundler configuration is also updated to use `rollup-plugin-minify-html-literals` to minify the html and css template literals.\r\n\r\nI also made one small change to `animationGroup`, where for some reason in one place it was firing the `onAnimationGroupPlayObservable` before actually changing the play/pause state. This means if a handler checks the play/pause state, it can be wrong.",

                "description": "This PR adds an `IblShadowsRenderPipeline` that adds shadowing for image-based lighting (IBL). It's applied as a post process after rendering your scene.\r\n\r\nAll control over the shadows will be done through the `IblShadowsRenderPipeline` object. After creating the pipeline, the first things that the user needs to do are:\r\n\r\n1. Assign an IBL image with setIblTexture . This function can take either a cube map or an equirectangular map.\r\n2. Add any meshes that you don't want casting shadows with addExcludedMesh . The apparent resolution of the shadows is directly tied to the size of the scene so you want to only include meshes that are important for shadows. e.g. a skybox should be excluded to avoid making the shadow-casting world huge as well as casting a shadow over everything.\r\n3. Update the scene bounds whenever a shadow-casting object moves using updateSceneBounds. This will recalculate the size of the scene and trigger voxelization. This is a pretty expensive operation in WebGL 2.0 so animated shadow-casters are probably not practical.\r\n\r\nThere are several pieces to how the effect is created. First, there are two passes that are only run when needed:\r\n\r\n* `_IblShadowsVoxelRenderer` - Responsible for building a voxel grid of the geometry in the scene as a 3D texture. This texture is used when tracing rays to the IBL and determining what is in shadow and what isn't. The voxelization only needs to be done when some geometry in the scene moves or is added/removed.\r\n* `_IblShadowsImportanceSamplingRenderer` - Responsible for building the CDF (cumulative distribution function) maps that will make it easy to pick the most important ray directions while sampling. This is only run when the IBL changes.\r\n\r\nThe `IblShadowsRenderPipeline` also requires several maps to be output from the prepass renderer, including world normals, world positions, velocity and depth. We should change this logic to render these per camera because, right now, the prepass renderer only supports a single camera.\r\n\r\nThe `IblShadowsRenderPipeline` creates four post process passes that do the per-frame shadow calculations and apply them to the scene:\r\n\r\n1. `_IblShadowsVoxelTracingPass` - this full-screen pass traces rays through the voxel grid using several of the prepass targets and the IBL CDF. In addition to voxel tracing, it also calculates screen-space shadows to catch small details and combines this with the lower-res shadows from the voxel tracing. This pass outputs a pretty noisy, greyscale approximation of the scene's shadows.\r\n2. `_IblShadowsSpatialBlurPass` - this full-screen pass blurs the shadow texture.\r\n3. `_IblShadowsAccumulationPass` - this full-screen pass accumulates the shadows over multiple frames. It copies both the accumulation and position buffers from the previous frame and uses them (in conjunction with the velocity buffer) to do this.\r\n\r\nThe output of the accumulation pass is composited onto the scene with another post-process effect.\r\n\r\nHere's a PG to test with:\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#8R5SSE#197\r\n\r\n**Some important exposed settings:**\r\n* voxel resolution - the dimension of the voxel grid, in voxels. This directly affects how sharp the shadows are. Must be power-of-two.\r\n* sample directions - how many samples of the voxel grid per pixel. Increasing this results in less noise but adds significantly to the per-frame cost of shadows\r\n* toggling screen-space shadows - SS shadows add small shadow detail close to the shadow caster but may not be needed in all scenes so this is togglable and has various settings to control how they behave.\r\n\r\n**Updating the voxel grid:**\r\n* When a mesh is added or removed from a scene, the voxelization of the scene is automatically rebuilt.\r\n* When a mesh moves in the scene, you must call `updateSceneBounds` to get the shadows to rebuild. Is there some place that I could do this automatically for users?\r\n\r\n**Things that still need work:**\r\n* The shadows are greyscale and are an approximation of the light intensity blocked by an object. They often over-darken surfaces because of this. I have plans to improve this and also add better support for coloured lighting.\r\n* IBL shadows don't currently work with multiple cameras (mostly due to this issue https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/viewport-issue-when-using-prepassrenderer/51276)\r\n* WebGPU is not yet fully supported. When WebGPU is working, I should be able to make use of compute shaders to significantly speed up voxel grid generation. This should make dynamic scene much more practical.\r\n* Various performance and quality tweaks. e.g. support downsizing the buffers for faster speed.\r\n![IBL Shadows](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/assets/1069125/7fb09b3f-93f2-40c2-aa8a-3e5161bed46e)\r\n",

                "description": "Addresses forum issue: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/customrootnode-null-does-not-work/52971\r\n\r\nEffectively the previous code did something like:\r\n```ts\r\nconst finalOption = passedInOption ?? defaultOption;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis logic is incorrect when `null` is a valid value for `passedInOption` and `defaultOption` is `undefined`. This is the case for `customRootNode`.\r\n\r\nI started to fix this in the current code, but in doing so realized that in a later revision of the original loader options PR, I also introduced a different issue. Specifically, the generic option copying logic is trying to iterate over the keys of the base class only, but since it uses `key in this`, it picks up all the properties of the derived `GLTFFileLoader` class and copies everything, which I don't think technically hurts anything but definitely not the intention. In an earlier iteration of that original PR, there was an instance of `GLTFLoaderOptions` used for default values, and I used to iterate over the keys in that object, which was correct. At some point, I ended up removing the default options instance, and since later I made `GLTFLoaderOptions` abstract to deal with callbacks in a backward compatible way, it's no longer even possible to instantiate the base class. I tried a bunch of different things to keep the generic copy logic while fixing these problems, but it just kept getting more and more complicated, so I just switched to to explicitly copy each property. If we add new options in the future, we'll just need to be careful to add a line to copy them.",

Without filtering, it can end up including things like instance matrices (not per vertex data). In this case, this also leads to things blowing up because `getVerticesData` assumes that all attribute data is per vertex. Possibly this should also be fixed so it is possible to call `getVerticesData` on an attribute that is not per vertex, but won't affect this particular issue.",

EDIT: Realized even though the TS is not working and `BABYLON` shows up as `any` even in JS, the JS still does work so I can at least test it that way.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Inspector always overrides glTF loader and extension options once it has been initialized. This is usually not the behavior you want, especially now with the new loader functions that take a config. In this case, all config values are just always overridden by inspector. We do still have use cases for setting loader and extension options in Inspector though, particularly in Sandbox (cc @sebavan). This change makes glTF loader and extension overrides through inspector optional, and off by default. It looks like this now by default:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a860ed3a-773a-45ed-b345-bb594b505604)\r\n\r\nWhen these override toggles are enabled, it looks like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e6e2218-d582-4ff2-80cc-709d8d2d70df)\r\n...\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/825e53d1-8e09-48ed-b963-21704811a133)\r\n...",

                "description": "In a recent [PR](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/15344), I added overloads of the various `SceneLoader` static functions that take an options param to make it easier to configure behavior of the loaders. In this PR, I am moving the new functions out of the static class and into module level functions. I'm doing this for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Conceptually we want to move away from static classes to improve tree shaking.\r\n2. Concretely in the alpha viewer I see 75% (7.5kb minified) of the SceneLoader code not being executed.\r\n\r\nIf we make this change now, then we don't have to deal with back compat later, and I can remove some of the code I previously had to add to distinguish between overloads (since the \"legacy\" functions are part of the static class, and the new ones are totally separate module level functions).\r\n\r\nThis change requires moving pretty much all the state and core functionality out of the SceneLoader static class and then having the static class functions just call the module level functions. This cuts the viewer package size down by about 5kb.\r\n\r\nI also tacked on a handful of small viewer related fixes.",

                "description": "This is an alternative approach to https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/15222. Compared to the original approach, this one:\r\n1. Has a simpler implementation and has a smaller impact on the API surface.\r\n1. Is slightly less type safe when adding new loader plugins or glTF extensions.\r\n1. Is much simpler for the caller.\r\n\r\nWith this approach, options are a type safe plain object with no factory functions. Invocation looks like this (for example):\r\n```ts\r\nawait SceneLoader.LoadAssetContainerAsync(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BabylonJS/Assets/master/meshes/LevelOfDetail.glb\", scene, {\r\n  onProgress: (event) => { },\r\n  pluginOptions: {\r\n    gltf: {\r\n      loadOnlyMaterials: true,\r\n      extensionOptions: {\r\n        MSFT_lod: {\r\n          maxLODsToLoad: 5,\r\n        },\r\n        MSFT_minecraftMesh: {\r\n          enabled: false,\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works by simply allowing plugins and extensions to augment the options interface, such that when you import a plugin or extension, it augments the options interface with options specific to the plugin or extension. From the consumer's standpoint, this is fully type safe, so you get clear intellisense showing you exactly how the options can be configured.\r\n\r\nI only implemented options for glTF in this PR, not any other loaders.\r\n\r\nThis is how it shows up with intellisense in VS Code:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b98ce86b-2f5e-48cb-a9cc-6b4b14464059)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d169d3f8-c5ba-4d07-bb2f-5331905e348e)\r\n\r\n@deltakosh, @sebavan, @bghgary ",

                "description": "Forum issue: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/onanimationgroupendobservable-can-only-trigger-once/52494/2\r\n\r\nIn a [recent change](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/15339), the `onAnimationEnd` event can be suppressed when an animation is stopped. `AnimationGroup` uses this, but also relies on `onAnimationEnd` to know when to remove an `Animatable`. Since it no longer fires, `Animatables` are not removed and just keep accumulating in the `_animatables` array (e.g. if you keep calling `stop`/`start` on the `AnimationGroup`). Additionally, since these `Animatable`s are accumulating indefinitely, the array will never be empty again and so `onAnimationGroupEndObservable` stops firing.\r\n\r\nSee https://playground.babylonjs.com/#7V0Y1I#4118\r\n\r\nThe change here is to explicitly remove the `Animatable`(s) when the `AnimationGroup` is stopped and the `onAnimationEnd` event is suppressed (and also suppress the `AnimationGroup` from triggering `onAnimationGroupEndObservable`). The `AnimationGroup` logic is a bit complex, so I'm not 100% sure this is the right fix.",

Removing this dependency reduces the package size by about 560kb.\r\n\r\nAlso included in this PR are a couple other small changes:\r\n- Switch from `string` to `URL` for model/env source. I don't think we want to support anything other than valid URLs for the viewer.\r\n- Also accept `File` for the model. It would make sense to do this for env as well, but this isn't currently supported in Babylon, so I'll revisit it later.\r\n- Remove a couple `console.log` statements that were added for debugging and accidentally left in with a previous PR.",

                "description": "This PR adds the last piece of planned local dev tooling for package size analysis for the new alpha viewer (building on top of the previous PR: https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/15319).\r\n\r\nThe primary change is the introduction of nyc/istanbul (nyc is the command line interface for the istanbul code coverage library) for code coverage so you can easily see what code is actually executed when the viewer runs. This is done by:\r\n1. Running `npm run start:coverage`, which launches a test app (will add more functionality later exercises more Babylon code for expected scenarios) that looks like this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d1ab5bc-f940-4a5a-9d18-59f25e9c5bf9)\r\n1. Clicking the \"Collect Coverage\" button, which collects the istanbul coverage data and generates and opens two reports that look like this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b30cae8-763d-4dfe-bce0-20fdada2529e)\r\nThe left report is the standard nyc html report. The right flame chart is a variation of the file/folder size flame chart where it specifically shows the approximate unused bytes per file/folder (e.g. `(1-coverage)*size`).\r\nThe goal is to make it easy to see where there might be opportunity to reduce the package size.\r\n\r\nTo make this work, the following is what happens under the hood:\r\n1. The code is tree shaken but not bundled into a single file, nor is it minified (to make line number status useful)\r\n1. The resulting code is then instrumented with the `nyc` command line\r\n1. The vite local server is started and the test web page is launched\r\n1. The vite local server uses middleware to expose an api that the page can send coverage information to\r\n1. The vite middleware saves the coverage data locally and invokes a report generation script\r\n1. The report generation script reads the coverage data and uses `nyc` to generate the html coverage report as well as a json summary, then uses the file/folder size flame chart generation script plus the json coverage summary to create a flame chart of unused bytes\r\n\r\nAnother change in this PR makes it easier to find import chains by just running an npm command like: `npm run import-chains -- standardmaterial`",

Uses `rollup-plugin-visualizer` to generate a stats json file that has a lot of raw data, including references between all modules.\r\n1. A script that takes a module path substring and the status json file and prints out all reference paths so you can immediately identify why a module was not tree shaken.\r\n\r\nSo with the [initial size analysis tooling](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/15298) changes you can find what is contributing to the size, and with this tooling you can figure out why that thing contributing to the size wasn't tree shaken.\r\n\r\nFor example, with the size analysis tooling I could see that `nodeMaterial.js` was included, which clearly is unnecessary. With the tooling in this PR, I was able to run the `npm run analyze` command followed by the script `node ../../../scripts/queryRollupStats.js nodeMaterial.js ./dist/analyze/stats.json` and see this output:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f840520-4cdc-4bf0-92e9-d2df578f4713)\r\n\r\nThis made it immediately obvious that `sceneHelpers.js` is pulling in a lot of other stuff. Having identified this, I factored out the one thing we were using from it (`scene.createDefaultSkybox`) and removed the reference to `sceneHelpers` (this will be coming in a separate PR). This alone brought the package size down from ~2.3mb to ~1.8mb. In a separate PR yet, I will be adding a bit more tooling to diff two flame charts so you can also easily understand why removing `sceneHelpers` has such a dramatic impact on package size.",

Currently we don't plan to create UMD bundles unless a real need surfaces.\r\n\r\nI was planning on creating these ESM bundles later, but I basically did this same thing last week when working on the size analysis tooling, so I just decided to do it now because it would be fast while it is still very fresh in my mind.",

                "description": "This PR primarily adds an `npm run analyze` command to the viewer alpha. This tree shakes and minifies the code (including the @babylonjs/core and @babylonjs/loaders), but does not bundle it, and then it runs a script that generates a flame chart to visualize the breakdown of file/folder sizes. The flame chart is an SVG that is interactive when opened in a browser (e.g. you can drill into the flame chart or search for file/folder names), and can also just be opened as an image.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds an `npm run start:bundle-test` that can be used to verify that all the right code is being included and that it actually executes correctly. ~The bundle-test also bundles into a single file just to simplify the test app and double check the overall size.~ I decided to get rid of this and just directly test the loose files. We will add a single file bundle to the public package later, so I don't really want to duplicate it here.\r\n\r\nThe minified bundle is about 2.3mb currently.\r\n\r\nThe flame chart looks like this:\r\n![FoldersSizes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9832e1c3-bc44-496a-900f-ff9bd06842cf)\r\n\r\nAnd then drilling into materials for example looks like this:\r\n<img width=\"1622\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1a5990b-7e06-435c-a3b8-3bac05b3bd56\">\r\n\r\nOther notes on this PR:\r\n- Set sideEffects to true in dev/core/package.json and dev/loaders/package.json (these were incorrectly set to false which messed up the bundling)\r\n- Added a short README with some notes on the new viewer package\r\n- Changed line endings in the package.json to CRLF (which unfortunately messes up the diff for this file in this PR)\r\n- Added various Rollup plugins and a Rollup config to transpile, tree shake, minify, but not bundle (for the size analysis flame chart input)\r\n- Added a Rollup config that does almost the same as above but bundles into a single file\r\n- Added a test html page that consumes the single bundle (to verify the tree shaked code)\r\n- Added a small script that gets file sizes and then uses an OSS flame chart generating perl script to create the flame chart\r\n\r\nFor the flame chart script, it just downloads the inner flame chart Perl script on demand. We could check it in, but I kind of like the node script being self contained and it makes it clear where the Perl script is coming from. Open to other perspectives on this.\r\n",

It is easier to setup a test app with Vite that consumes the source (e.g. index.html just references the Viewer index.ts directly as a module as opposed to WebPack where it has to reference the WebPack output explicitly).\r\n3. It was fairly easy to get working debugging in the test app's index.html inline scripts while I've not figured out how to get that to work with WebPack.\r\n4. Vite is super fast, less waiting. :)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a few things were harder to configure with Vite:\r\n1. Getting my Vite test app to correctly debug other parts of the code required manually configuring the `pathMapping` in launch.json.\r\n2. Getting the VSCode task to recognize that Vite is up and running required manual configuration.\r\n\r\nOverall I still prefer moving to Vite as I think the benefits outweigh the costs.",

It actually makes sense to do it before, as the point is passed as a variable.\n\nWe don't use the point at all in any of the implementations of onTouch in the framework. It can be considered a breaking change if someone created their own input implementation and implemented onTouch which uses point.x and point.y, expecting it to be a different value (the value before the current frame, or 0,0 on first frame).

Weights are not considered in this computation.\r\n\r\nSkinning is computed by computing the max extents per bone. Again, weights are not considered in this computation.\r\n\r\nThe max extents are converted into the corners of the bounding box before computing the final max extents.\r\n\r\nAnimations are considered by stepping through the animation group at a fixed step in seconds. For skinning, each bone's corners are updated with the bone's final matrix for each frame step.\r\n\r\nThis function is significantly faster than using `mesh.refreshBoundingInfo` applying skeleton and/or morph targets looping through the animation frames in a similar fashion.",

Since I don't have code using it quite yet, I added unit tests. If there is opposition to adding this code before it is being used, then I can sit on this PR, it just means I'll need to update the min ver on the @babylonjs/core dependency and anyone using the alpha viewer will have to update their @babylonjs/core dependency.",

Therefore, the alpha package has a unique name, but this\r\n// is not the actual name we want to publish it under. This script copies the name and version from the legacy package.json to the\r\n// alpha package.json, appends \"-alpha\" to the version, and removes the private flag, scripts, and devDependencies from the alpha,\r\n// and finally deletes the legacy package.json. This script should be run after the alpha package has been built and before it is\r\n// published. This script is not necessary when the legacy package is deprecated and the alpha package is published under the same\r\n// name as the legacy package.\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven this, the high level aspects of this new folder are:\r\n- Includes a rollup based build that bundles everything into a single file but still uses esm (webpack is good at creating umd bundle files, but not esm bundle files).\r\n  - Bundling to esm allows us to not \"ship our directory structure,\" which gives us the freedom to update the directory structure or file names in the viewer source without creating back compat issues.\r\n  - It also bundles the d.ts files into a single d.ts\r\n  - Later when we introduce dynamic imports, it won't be one bundle file but rather a handful. Technically people could import the dynamic import bundles, but it's unlikely someone would do so since rollup basically gives them random names.\r\n- Includes a prepublish.cjs script that modifies the package.json and deletes the legacy viewer package.json so the new alpha viewer can be published with the same name (with the `-alpha` version suffix).\r\n\r\nSeparately, @RaananW (or me with @RaananW's help) will modify the CI build to run this prepublish step and then specifically publish the new alpha viewer package. That will come in a different PR.\r\n\r\nI also had to make a few changes to the actual viewer source code to get this all working (tested a local build of the package in a vanilla-ts Vite project).",

It is on per default, but since tabIndex is -1 per default, it shouldn't change anything.\n\nThere is a slight typing change, but it shouldn't be a breaking change, as we moved from an interface to a class that holds the entire interface (and actually implements it).\nThe only real breaking change is the onFocusObservable in virtual keyboard, which is not often used.\n\nTest with this playground - #KKA6L4#16",

There were a couple significant problems with the code that basically required a rewrite of this logic:\r\n1. It was writing separate segments of data to the buffer (and separate buffer views) for each submesh. This is always wrong for indexed geometry, and is broken if there are multiple submeshes.\r\n2. The logic for determining the range of vertex data to write per submesh was just wrong, and could only work for indexed geometry with one submesh.\r\n\r\nFor 2, I couldn't even tell what the logic was trying to do:\r\n```ts\r\nfor (let k = meshPrimitive.verticesStart; k < meshPrimitive.verticesCount; ++k) {\r\n  index = meshPrimitive.indexStart + k * stride;\r\n    const vertexData = Vector3.FromArray(meshAttributeArray, index);\r\n```\r\n`verticesStart` is only meaningful for non-indexed geometry, so combining `indexStart` and `verticesStart` in any way doesn't make sense. I think this code only worked because it was only ever tested in cases where both `indexStart` and `verticesStart` were zero.\r\n\r\nOverall, the approach now is to write all the morph target vertex data for the entire mesh and create an associated buffer view for each attribute (where morph data is present), then create one accessor per submesh per morph target that potentially has an offset into the buffer view (for submeshes beyond the first).\r\n\r\nThis does not fix the pre-existing issues with non-indexed geometry in general, but that should be handled in a separate PR. This approach does not prevent us from making non-indexed geometry work, there are just additional changes needed that can be done in isolation from these changes.",

This is needed if a constructor has a public member that is documented and has a default value. These are the ones I found, I guess there might be more and I will try adding a step to check for missing values in the future.",

                "description": "I recently spent a bit of time going through the `SceneLoader` and `GLTFFileLoader` code in preparation for improving gltf loader options and found some parts of the code hard to grok due to a lot of use of `any`, a lot of casting, and some seemingly somewhat incorrect types. I cleaned this up as I was going through the code to understand it, and wanted to get these changes reviewed separately from upcoming glft loader options changes. The changes in this PR are:\r\n\r\n- Lots of replacement of `any` with `unknown` (safer and easier to understand expectations when reading the code).\r\n- Some replacements of `any` with specific types where they were in fact known (`meshNames` parameter, `directLoad` return type, `IGLTFLoaderData` in some cases).\r\n- Added a `ISceneLoaderPluginInternal` interface with the `onDisposeObservable` property. It seems like the intent was to hide this from the public contract, but it's hard to say for sure from the given code. Alternatively this could be added as an optional property to `ISceneLoaderPluginBase` if we want it to be public.\r\n- Registered plugins were tracked as `ISceneLoaderPlugin | ISceneLoaderPluginAsync | ISceneLoaderPluginFactory`, but really `SceneLoader.RegisterPlugin` requires the plugin to be `ISceneLoaderPlugin | ISceneLoaderPluginAsync` and optionally allows it to be `ISceneLoaderPluginFactory`. Therefore I updated this type to be `(ISceneLoaderPlugin | ISceneLoaderPluginAsync) & Partial<ISceneLoaderPluginFactory> & Partial<ISceneLoaderPluginInternal>` which matches what is actually happening and removes the need for some casts.",

In our project it could be several gigabytes of leaked memory in a few seconds.\r\nThe proposed solution here is that thinEngine should use the `webGLHardwareTexture`'s function `release` to let it delete its resources, instead of directly deleting (only) the WebGLTexture from the context directly.",

However, if you set the `parent` on that `Node` and then set it back to `null`, then it does get added to `rootNodes`. From what I can tell, this is just wrong behavior and is a bug. My proposed fix is to add an optional parameter to the `Node` constructor that controls whether it gets added to the `rootNodes`. This is the same pattern that already existed for the same purpose with `TransformNode` and it's derived classes (e.g. `AbstratMesh`). That said, I personally don't love this pattern because as far as I can tell the `isPure` idea is meant to be an implementation detail to deal with the subclassing, but is publicly exposed (I know there is already a lot of this across the API). An alternative would be to just add this to the `Node` constructor and not change any of the subclasses:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nif (this.constructor === Node) {\r\n    this._addToSceneRootNodes();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would just be saying \"if a `Node` is directly constructed, add it to the scene's rootNodes, otherwise it must be a subclass, and the subclass is responsible for deciding how to add it to the rootNodes.\" Thoughts @deltakosh or anyone else?",

Output type is updated if the output type of the node connected to left/right is updated\r\n\r\nWe had talked about adding a visual test with the [PG](https://playground.babylonjs.com/#D1H1LY#36) that helped reveal a bug around number 4 above, but it's quite complex and pulls in external assets (e.g. from dropbox). I thought about boiling this down to a simpler NME graph containing a MultiplyBlock where the left and right are floats but then the left switches to vector3 (this is effectively the min repro) and render something with that simple shader, but it didn't seem like this really added anything beyond what we'd get from unit tests, so I just wrote unit tests for the core issue (dynamically changing output types). If anyone still thinks a visual test would be useful for this scenario, let me know.",

                "title": "Update Tensor types, for accuracy",
                "description": "This PR changes types on the Tensor API to be more accurate. The changes are described in more detail below.\r\n\r\n*Note: `Class` is used in place of some class in the Tensor API*\r\n\r\n### 1. `this` vs `Class`\r\n\r\nIn the example, `T extends this` and `DeepImmutable<this>` are inaccurate. The method does not need the arguments to be `this`, only that they are `Class`. When I was originally creating the Tensor API, I used `this` out of convenience. Doing so has caused several problems.\r\n\r\nUsing `this` instead of `Class` makes the type more strict. This is not needed with the Tensor API classes because they are compatible wth `Class`, not just `this`. The PR changes `this` to `Class` where `this` is not needed. Note that the return types of functions which return the value `this` are the type `this`.\r\n\r\nA brief example:\r\n```ts\r\nclass Primate {\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * Say hi to another primate;\r\n\t*/\r\n\tsayHi(other: this): void;\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Human extends Primate { /* ... */ }\r\n\r\nconst sue = new Primate();\r\nconst ian = new Human();\r\n\r\nian.sayHi(sue); // error, `sue` is not a `Human`, but we want humans to be able to say hi to other primates\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Introduction of `I`, the \"interface\" type, for compatibility.\r\n\r\nRecently, I've been working with shaders in GLSL. I've been amazed by the developer experience with operator overloading and thought something similar would be a huge boost for the Tensor API classes.\r\n\r\nI noticed a significant part of the vector math functions are of the form\r\n```ts\r\npublic operationToRef<T extends Class>(other: DeepImmutable<Class>, result: T): T {\r\n\tresult.x = this.x [[operator]] other.x;\r\n\tresult.y = this.y [[operator]] other.y;\r\n\t// ...\r\n\treturn result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy line of thinking:\r\n1. All of the classes have a simple interface type (i.e. `IClassLike`)\r\n2. This interface type has coordinate members\r\n3. The method only modifies the coordinate members\r\n4. It is trivial to use the interface instead of the class for types\r\n5. Complex types that implement the interface can be used transparently.\r\n\r\nFor example, with `Vector4`:\r\n```ts\r\npublic addInPlace(other: DeepImmutable<IVector4Like>): this {\r\n\tthis.x += other.x;\r\n\tthis.y += other.y;\r\n\tthis.z += other.z;\r\n\tthis.w += other.w;\r\n\treturn this;\r\n}\r\n\r\n//similar for add, addToRef, subtract, etc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich can then be used like `vec2.addInPlace(vec4)`. Note that this will not work for `vec3.*(vec4)` since the `Vector3` functions use the internal `_x`/`_y`/`_z`, which are not used by `Vector2` and `Vector4`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, when adding a vector of lower dimension, like `vec4.add(vec2)`, some coordinates may be set to `NaN`. This is reflected in the types. For example, `vec4.*` will only take an `IVector4Like`, so `IVector2Like` will give an error. While adding `|| 0` to the end of many operations would fix this simple issue, I have *not* done so due to performance concerns.\r\n\r\n### 3. Overengineered: `(value.constructor as Constructor<typeof Class, T>)`\r\n\r\n`(value.constructor as Constructor<typeof Class, T>)` is an incredibly verbose statement, which unnecessarily complicates things. Using `Class` instead makes the code much more readable, and provides a minor performance boost, since there is a single variable access (i.e. `Class`) instead of a variable access followed by a property lookup, which also involves the value prototype.",

                "description": "This is a breaking change that should never influence any of our users.\n\nWe set the canvas to be xrCompatible per default. mainly because there was no downside for the devs, and they could override this. However, this thread has shed some light on a single issue that was found with it - https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/browser-back-forward-cache-is-blocked-when-using-babylon-js-due-to-webxr/49903, namely browser back-forward cache is blocked when using a WebXR-enabled canvas. \n\nThis PR sets the flag to false per default and simplifies the mechanism in which a canvas is prepared for XR compatibility.\n\nPlease wait with merging this until the community has tested the snapshot, as I only have an emulator for the time being. Of course, it works correctly in both the windows XR emulator and the WebXR web-based emulator",

                "description": "I previously changed NME math nodes to allow any valid combinations of inputs to either the left or right inputs, and determine the output type dynamically based on the input types. When a graph is being wired up in NME by the user, this works as expected because the output type is re-evaluated any time left/right inputs connect/disconnect, and the type flowing into the left/right input is already known at the time of connection. When loading a saved node graph, the order of operations is not the same. Specifically, the connections can be made before the type flowing into the left/right input is known, which means once the type is known, it is too late and we have already incorrectly inferred the output type. This is what happened in the [PG](https://playground.babylonjs.com/?version=7.1.0#D1H1LY#36) discussed here: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/liquid-shader-node-material-shenanigans-how-to-translate-this-to-babylonian/42447/8\r\n\r\nTo address this, the connection point will now notify via an observable when the output type has changed (or at least may have changed). Since the output type is determined by various different states, changes to any of those states have to be observed to know when the output type has (or may have) changed. This also makes it so that in general, type changes can flow through the graph at regular edit time. Here is an example:\r\n![NME-cascading-output-type](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/assets/5084643/76812a9e-2c5a-4ea1-a408-0f4089bd048d)\r\n",

For example : `\"AbstractMesh.checkCollisions = true;\"`\r\n\r\nIt is based on the `target` property of the `React.Component` considered (CheckboxLine, SliderLine, ColorLine, etc...)\r\n* `this.props.target` is the node considered (ex : `AbstractMesh`)\r\n* `this.props.propertyName` is the property (ex : `checkCollisions`)\r\n* `this.props.target[this.props.propertyName!]` is the value\r\n\r\nIn order to access the Class name of the target, `this.props.target.constructor.name` works in dev preview mode, but returns a single (random) letter such as \"e\" after the build. I suspect this is due to the mangling + minify at build;\r\n\r\nThat's why I replaced `this.props.target.constructor.name` by the `getInstanceType()` function, which finds a `instanceof` match over BABYLON classes.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to propose a neater solution.\r\n\r\n([Demo Video](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/babylonjs/original/3X/3/8/3833bf84f734ef25c7e7503f4f1f490c5dab4357.mp4))\r\n____\r\n**Addind window.debugNode :**\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm putting the reference of the selected node into `window.debugNode`;\r\nThis is soooo usefull, already since it's built on my side, I'm using it multiple times per day !\r\n* You select a mesh and type `let mesh = window.debugNode;`\r\n* You select a material and type `let mat = window.debugNode;`\r\nAnd then you can work in the console using `mesh` and `mat` ...\r\n\r\n([Demo Video](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/babylonjs/original/3X/0/8/08c73f8152af42976194c326211e9d8cea4d91f6.mp4))",

                "description": "This is addressing the issue described here: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/texture-textureformat-does-not-return-right-value/50128/3\r\n\r\nFor WebGL (ThinEngine), the requested texture format is ignored in some cases when assigning the InternalTexture format. I believe it is correctly respected for compressed textures due to the texture loader assigning the format. If the format is unspecified, the deduced default texture format is also stored. But in other cases, the requested texture format is not stored correctly in the InternalTexture (even though it does affect how the texture is loaded).\r\n\r\nThis change makes it work more like WebGPU (WebGPUEngine) - when a texture is created the requested format is stored in the InternalTexture within the `prepareTexture` callback. Since this happens before the `prepareTextureProcessFunction` callback, in the WebGL case `prepareTextureProcessFunction` can be simplified to just use the InternalTexture format which by this time has correctly been assigned.",

This commit resolves this by dynamically adjusting the texture's dimensions based on the number of colors and the maximum texture size supported by the engine. This change ensures robust handling of large color sets by distributing colors across multiple rows in the texture when necessary, preventing overflow and maintaining correct color rendering.",

                "description": "This PR presents a few changes to Effect and ThinEngine architecture to allow shader precompilation before an engine is constructed.\nUsing the following ode will allow you to generate create a (WebGL) Pipeline context using an existing context. While this is running you can do any other async tasks, like loading the Engine and its dependencies.\n\nNote - the shader is being cached, so it will not be recompiled even if Babylon requests it. The important part is maintaining the generated shader name so that when an effect is created based on the shader code it will take the compiled shader from cache.\n\nThis code will precompile a provided shader:\n\n```javascript\nimport { generatePipelineContext } from '@babylonjs/core/Materials/effect.functions';\nimport { _preparePipelineContext, _stateObject, createPipelineContext } from '@babylonjs/core/Engines/thinEngine.functions';\n\nexport async function compileShader(\n   id: string,\n   context: WebGL2RenderingContext | WebGLRenderingContext,\n   options: {\n      vertex: string;\n      fragment: string;\n   },\n): Promise<void> {\n   await generatePipelineContext(\n      {\n         shaderNameOrContent: {\n            vertexSource: options.vertex,\n            fragmentSource: options.fragment,\n         },\n         key: id,\n      },\n      context,\n      createPipelineContext,\n      _preparePipelineContext,\n   );\n}\n```\n\nOf course it can be a little more complex than that. It is technically possible to \"serialize\" existing shaders and then pre-load them. Having said that, precompiling the standard shader(s) might be a bit challenging, depending on many different factors.",

But I want to apologize to reviewers. This is a monster PR like none before :(\r\n\r\nThe only breaking change I'm anticipating is that every .engine properties across the lib will now be of `AbstractEngine` instead of `Engine` (but same methods so the impact should be almost non existent).\r\n\r\nThinEngine and Engine are almost unchanged. The big rework is two folds:\r\n- Declare all specific methods (the one different between webgl and webgpu) as `abstract` methods on `AbstractEngine`\r\n- Move Common functions from `ThinEngine` to `AbstractEngine`\r\n\r\nWith that in place, we will have a clear and easy way to implements `ThinWebGPUEngine`.\r\n\r\n@RaananW: I would need your help as I moved NpmPackage and Version from `ThinEngine` to `AbstractEngine`.\r\nEdit: I did it but want to be sure with your approval ;)",

For example:\r\n\r\n![NGE-Connection](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/assets/5084643/228a93c3-7bd6-4da0-8310-d0db9ac3dc54)\r\n\r\nIn this change, I made it so that it is equivalent whether an output of another node is connected to the left or right input of a math node, and also the order of operations doesn't matter. Each time the connection state changes, it re-evaluates the accepted types for each input (left and right), as well as the output type based on those input types.\r\n\r\n![NGE-Flexible-Multiply](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/assets/5084643/3be45105-d06c-45a8-9151-7725b3c306b2)\r\n\r\n~~I realized part way through doing this that mathBlock is NGE specific, and the set of math related blocks for NME have the same limitations, so ideally these changes would be made for both (or the same mathBlock would be shared between the two if possible).~~\r\nEDIT: There are differences between the NME and NGE math related blocks, so while I didn't end up sharing the code between the two, I did factor out a `MathBlock` base class for the NME Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide blocks that has logic similar to what I added to the NGE `MathBlock`.",

                "description": "After these changes it will be possible to use Draco in Node environment using the following code:\n\n```javascript\nconst Draco = require(\"./draco_decoder_gltf.js\");\nconst wasm = fs.readFileSync(\"./draco_decoder_gltf.wasm\");\n\nBABYLON.DracoCompression.Configuration.decoder.wasmBinary = wasm;\nBABYLON.DracoCompression.Configuration.decoder.jsModule = Draco;\n```\n\nDependencies are not included in the UMD version, and node doesn't fully support ESM, so it will still be required to download the resources once from our CDN and keep them locally on the project directory. A different approach could be to install @babylonjs/core and just require the module and wasm from the assets directory.\n\nThis PR also makes it possible to easily override the worker pool configuration option, to allow a more streamlined way of using the decompressor. Setting the static workerPool will avoid creating your own instance of the DracoCompression class:\n\n```javascript\n// index.js\n\nimport wasm from \"@babylonjs/dependencies/draco/draco_decoder_gltf.wasm?arraybuffer\"; // also works from \"draco3dgltf\" package\nimport { AutoReleaseWorkerPool } from \"@babylonjs/core/Misc/workerPool.js\";\nimport { DracoCompression } from \"@babylonjs/core/Meshes/Compression/dracoCompression.js\";\nimport { initializeWebWorker } from \"@babylonjs/core/Meshes/Compression/dracoCompressionWorker.js\";\nimport { Tools } from \"@babylonjs/core/Misc/tools.js\";\nimport { VertexBuffer } from \"@babylonjs/core/Meshes/buffer.js\";\n\nconst workerPool = new AutoReleaseWorkerPool(4, () => {\n  const worker = new Worker(new URL(\"./worker.js\", import.meta.url), {\n    type: \"module\",\n  });\n  return initializeWebWorker(worker, wasm);\n});\n\nDracoCompression.Configuration.decoder.workerPool = workerPool;\n\n// worker.js\nimport { workerFunction } from \"@babylonjs/core/Meshes/Compression/dracoCompressionWorker.js\";\nimport \"@babylonjs/dependencies/draco/draco_decoder_gltf.js\";\n\nworkerFunction();\n```",

If it is not the same a prompt will ask if you want to switch to the other engine. It is still possible to cancel and continue in the current engine. If the snippet will be saved again, the current engine will be stored again (i.e. - engine type is per snippet version and is not a metadata item).\n\nIt is possible to override this behavior by adding `?webgpu` or `?engine=ENGINE-TYPE` to the URL. This way it doesn't matter what the snippet engine is, the URL-type will be used (works with webgpu).\n\nOf course, this will only be enabled to snippets that are stored after this is merged.

                "description": "Currently in master, `npm install` fails because it can't resolve the optional architecture specific nx packages. This is because the architecture specific packages are missing from the package-lock.json. This change adds those back to package-lock.json to fix the `npm install` error that happens in a clean repo. This was done by regenerating the package-lock.json locally. This resulted in a lot of changes, but it's mostly tiny changes like the LICENSE property being removed for all packages in the lock file. This seems to be due to a difference in how the package-lock.json file gets generated locally vs. the package-lock.json update that happens in the build process (see below), but @RaananW said these small changes are expected and ok from his experience. Unfortunately this means you can't diff the file in GitHub.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of one of the architecture specific packages that was added back to the package-lock.json:\r\n![image](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/assets/5084643/4d0d2a6d-8bec-431a-b585-22dd96451b75)\r\n\r\nThe reason these optional architecture specific packages are missing from the package-lock.json is due to a step in the automated release process where package versions in the package-lock.json are updated. This step regenerates the package-lock.json, but results in any packages not present in node_modules to be removed from the package-lock.json which is then checked back in. This means that if nothing else is done, this will break again next time a release is cut. Fortunately @RaananW already planned to remove part of the step that causes this problem and is no longer needed anyway. He's expecting to make that change on Monday, but this change is also needed and at least fixes master.",

Since I added the above, it applies to *all* json files in the repo (not just those under `packages/**/src`. I don't want formatting changes to be unexpectedly applied next time someone makes a change to one of these files, so I ran the prettier formatter on these files as well. Some of these files will look like every line changed, but this is because prettier wants CRLF in json files, not LF.\r\n5. `package.json`: The format and lint commands defined in package.json don't work on Mac.

In fields, it is the current class.\r\n- `Tensor` and its related types will be defined in `src/Maths/tensor.ts` unless otherwise noted\r\n- Signatures are shown, not implementation. \r\n- The shown signatures are not necessarily the same as implementation (e.g. `Signature<T extends number>` may be shown when it is implemented as `Signature<T> = T extends number ? ... : never`\r\n\r\n#### Status\r\n\r\n- [x] [`Vector`](#user-content-Vector)\r\n- [x] [Tuple manipulation and math types](#user-content-math-types)\r\n- [x] [`Constructor`](#user-content-Constructor)\r\n- [x] [`MultidimensionalArray`](#user-content-MultidimensionalArray)\r\n- [x] [`TensorValue`](#user-content-TensorValue)\r\n- [x] [`Tensor`](#user-content-Tensor)\r\n    - [x] Methods from `Vector`\r\n    - [x] [`Tensor.dimension`](#user-content-Tensor-dimension)\r\n    - [ ] [`Tensor.From`](#user-content-Tensor-From)\r\n    - [ ] [`Tensor.as`](#user-content-Tensor-as)\r\n    - [ ] [`Tensor.sum`](#user-content-Tensor-sum)\r\n    - [x] [`Tensor.rank`](#user-content-Tensor-rank)\r\n    - [ ] [`Tensor.value`](#user-content-Tensor-value)\r\n- [ ] [`isTensor`](#user-content-isTensor)\r\n- [ ] [`isTensorValue`](#user-content-isTensorValue)\r\n- [ ] [`getTensorDimension`](#user-content-getTensorDimension)\r\n- [ ] [`convertTensor`](#user-content-convertTensor)[*](#user-content-note-optional)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#user-content-note-optional\" id=\"note-optional\">*</a> May not be included in the proposal\r\n\r\n### <a href=\"#user-content-Vector\" id=\"Vector\">Vector</a>\r\n\r\nDefined in `src/Maths/math.vector.ts`\r\n\r\nThis PR includes `Vector` from #13699. `Vector` extends `Tensor` and adds normalization methods, `length`, and `lengthSquared`. It is implemented by `Vector2`, `Vector3`, and `Vector4`.\r\n\r\n### <a href=\"#user-content-math-types\" id=\"math-types\">Tuple manipulation and math types</a>\r\n\r\nDefined in `src/types.ts`\r\nThe following types are being added for compile-time math and tuple manipulation, which is necessary for `MultidimensionalArray`. They are included as a single block for brevity.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype Empty = [];\r\ntype Shift<T extends unknown[]>;\r\ntype First<T extends unknown[]>;\r\ntype Unshift<T extends unknown[], A>;\r\ntype Pop<T extends unknown[]>;\r\ntype Last<T extends unknown[]>;\r\ntype Push<T extends unknown[], A>;\r\ntype Concat<A extends unknown[], B extends unknown[]>;\r\ntype Remove<A extends unknown[], B extends unknown[]>;\r\ntype Length<T extends unknown[]>;\r\ntype FromLength<N extends number>;\r\ntype Increment<N extends number>;\r\ntype Decrement<N extends number>;\r\ntype Add<A extends number, B extends number>;\r\ntype Subtract<A extends number, B extends number>;\r\ntype Member<T, D>;\r\ntype Flatten<A extends unknown[], D>;\r\ntype MultidimensionalArray<T, D extends number>\r\ntype Tuple<T, N extends number>;\r\ntype FlattenTuple<T>;\r\ntype IsTuple<T>;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### <a href=\"#user-content-Constructor\" id=\"Constructor\">Constructor</a>\r\n\r\nDefined in `src/types.ts`\r\n```ts\r\ntype Constructor<C extends new (...args: any[]) => any, I extends InstanceType<C>>\r\n```\r\nDefines a single type for constructors. This replaces `Vector2Constructor`, `Vector3Constructor`, `Vector4Constructor`, `QuaternionConstructor`, and `MatrixConstructor`.\r\n\r\nInstead of using `Vector3Constructor<this>`, you would instead use `Constructor<typeof Vector3, this>`. The `typeof` is needed to get the type for the class instead of the instance, and can't be done inside the type since Typescript prohibits taking the `typeof` a type.\r\n\r\n### <a href=\"#user-content-MultidimensionalArray\" id=\"MultidimensionalArray\">MultidimensionalArray</a>\r\n\r\nDefined in `src/types.ts`\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype MultidimensionalArray<T, D extends number>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRepresents a multidimensional array of `T` with depth `D`.\r\n\r\n### <a href=\"#user-content-TensorValue\" id=\"TensorValue\">TensorValue</a>\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype TensorValue<T> = T extends Tensor<infer V> ? V : never;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### <a href=\"#user-content-Tensor\" id=\"Tensor\">Tensor</a>\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndeclare class Tensor<V>\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Tensor` is a `declare class` for tensor-like classes to implement.\r\n\r\n`Tensor` includes all of the methods in `Vector` from #13699. This includes\r\n- Math operations (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `scale`, ...)\r\n- Array conversion (`fromArray`, `toArray`, `asArray`, ...)\r\n\t- Since the type parameter is no longer assignable to `number[]`, the return type for array-related methods is `number[]`. See `Tensor.value`\r\n- Transferring (`clone`, `copyFrom`, `copyFromFloats`, ...)\r\n- The above methods' `InPlace`, `ToRef`, `FromFloats`, etc.\r\n\r\nIt adds or changes the following methods:\r\n\r\n#### <a href=\"#user-content-Tensor-dimension\" id=\"Tensor-dimension\">Tensor.dimension</a>\r\n\r\n```ts\r\npublic abstract dimension: number[];\r\n```\r\n`dimension` is the mathematical dimension<sup>[2](#user-content-footnote-2)</sup> of the tensor. In dynamic tensor types, it can be defined as a getter.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```ts\r\nconst vec3 = new Vector3(),\r\n\tvec4 = new Vector4(),\r\n\tmatrix = new Matrix();\r\n\r\nvec3.dimension // [3]\r\nvec4.dimension // [4]\r\nmatrix.dimension // [4, 4]\r\n``` \r\n\r\n#### <a href=\"#user-content-Tensor-From\" id=\"Tensor-From\">Tensor.From</a>\r\n\r\n```ts\r\npublic static From(source: Tensor, fillValue: number = 0): CurrentClass;\r\n```\r\n`From` creates a new instance of `CurrentClass` from `source`.\r\n`source`: The tensor to copy data from.\r\n`fillValue`: The value to use for filling empty parts of the resulting `CurrentClass`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```ts\r\nconst vec3 = new Vector3(1, 2, 3);\r\nconst vec4 = Vector4.From(vec3, 4); // { 1, 2, 3, 4 }\r\nconst matrix = Matrix.From(vec3, 0); // this is possible!\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `From` could be changed to `From(...args: [...Tensor[], number]): CurrentClass` to allow multiple inputs. This is better understood by this **invalid** Typescript signature (since rest parameters must be last):\r\n```ts\r\npublic static From(...source: Tensor[], fillValue: number = 0): CurrentClass;\r\n```\r\n\r\n> 🛈 Implementations may write their own conversion code or use `convertTensor`.\r\n\r\n#### <a href=\"#user-content-Tensor-as\" id=\"Tensor-as\">Tensor.as</a>\r\n```ts\r\npublic as<T extends typeof Tensor>(type: T, fillValue: number = 0): InstanceType<T>;\r\n```\r\n`as` creates an instance of `type` from an instance of `CurrentClass`.\r\n`type`: The class to create an instance of.\r\n`fillValue`: The value to use for filling empty parts of the resulting instance.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```ts\r\nconst vec3 = new Vector3(1, 2, 3);\r\nconst vec4 = vec3.as(Vector4, 4); // { 1, 2, 3, 4 }\r\nconst matrix = vec3.as(Matrix, 0);\r\n```\r\n\r\n> 🛈 Implementations may write their own conversion code or use `convertTensor`.\r\n\r\n#### <a href=\"#user-content-Tensor-sum\" id=\"Tensor-sum\">Tensor.sum</a>\r\n```ts\r\npublic sum(): number;\r\n```\r\n`sum` return the sum of the components of the `Tensor`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```ts\r\nconst vec3 = new Vector3(1, 2, 3),\r\n\tvec4 = new Vector4(4, 5, 6, 7),\r\n\tmatrix = new Matrix();\r\n\r\nvec3.sum() // 6\r\nvec4.sum() // 22\r\nmatrix.sum() // 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n> ⚠ The return value of the `lengthSquared` or `length` method of vectors is **not** the same as the return value of `sum`.\r\n\r\n#### <a href=\"#user-content-Tensor-rank\" id=\"Tensor-rank\">Tensor.rank</a>\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic abstract rank: number;\r\n```\r\nThe `rank` of a tensor is the number of indices required to uniquely select each element of the tensor.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```ts\r\nconst vec3 = new Vector3(),\r\n\tmatrix = new Matrix();\r\n\r\nvec3.rank // 1\r\nmatrix.rank // 2\r\n```\r\n> 🛈 The `rank` of a `Tensor` is the same as its `dimension.length`.\r\n\r\n#### <a href=\"#user-content-Tensor-value\" id=\"Tensor-value\">Tensor.value</a>\r\n```\r\npublic get value(): V;\r\npublic set value(value: V): void;\r\n```\r\n\r\n`value` is the values of the tensor in a multidimensional array with the type `V` (the type parameter of the class). Unlike `dimension`, this *must* be implemented as a getter and setter.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```ts\r\nconst vec3 = new Vector3(),\r\n\tmatrix = new Matrix();\r\n\r\nvec3.value\r\n// [0, 0, 0]\r\n\r\nmatrix.value\r\n// [ [ 0, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 0 ] ]\r\n\r\nvec3.value = [ 1, 2, 3 ];\r\nvec3.x // 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### <a href=\"#user-content-isTensor\" id=\"isTensor\">isTensor</a>\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction isTensor<V>(value: unknown): value is Tensor<V>;\r\n```\r\nChecks if a value is a `Tensor`.\r\nExample:\r\n```ts\r\nconst vec3 = new Vector3();\r\nisTensor(vec3) // true\r\nisTensor(vec3.value) // false\r\nisTensor([1, 2, 3]) // false\r\nisTensor(0) // false\r\nisTensor(null) // false\r\n```\r\n\r\n### <a href=\"#user-content-isTensorValue\" id=\"isTensorValue\">isTensorValue</a>\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction isTensorValue<T>(value: unknown): value is TensorValue<T>;\r\n```\r\nChecks if a value is a `TensorValue`.\r\nExample:\r\n```ts\r\nconst vec3 = new Vector3();\r\nisTensorValue<1>(vec3) // false\r\nisTensorValue<Vector3>(vec3.value) // true\r\nisTensorValue<1>([1, 2, 3]) // true\r\nisTensorValue<0>([1, 2, 3]) // false\r\nisTensorValue<1>(0) // false\r\nisTensorValue<0>(0) // true\r\nisTensorValue<1>(null) // false\r\n```\r\n### <a href=\"#user-content-getTensorDimension\" id=\"getTensorDimension\">getTensorDimension</a>\r\n```ts\r\nfunction getTensorDimension(value: Tensor | TensorValue): number[];\r\n```\r\n\r\n`getTensorDimension` returns the mathimatical dimension<sup>[2](#user-content-footnote-2)</sup> of `value`, similar to `Tensor.dimension`. If `value` is not a `Tensor` or `TensorValue`, it will throw a `TypeError`\r\n\r\n> 🛈  Dynamic `Tensor` based classes should use `getTensorDimension` for their `dimension` implementations. Fixed-dimension `Tensor` sub-classes need not use `getTensorDimension`.\r\n\r\n### *(optional)* <a href=\"#user-content-convertTensor\" id=\"convertTensor\">convertTensor</a>\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction convertTensor<T extends  typeof Tensor>(TensorClass: T, tensor: Tensor, fillValue: number = 0): InstanceType<T>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreates a new `T` with the values of `tensor`. Unlike `Tensor.as`, it performs more error checking and does not need a starting instance (and therefore avoids the dreaded `'methodName' does not exist on undefined` error).\r\n\r\n### <a href=\"#user-content-behavior\" id=\"behavior\">Behavior changes</a>\r\n\r\n- The `Color3` and `Color4` methods  `multiplyToRef`, `scaleToRef`, `scaleAndAddToRef`, `clampToRef`, `addToRef`, and `subtractToRef` have had their return types changed from `this` to the reference instance.\r\n\r\n## Considerations\r\n\r\n1. Static methods related to data manipulation (e.g. `Add`, `Normalize`, `Lerp`) and non-static normalization methods are outside the scope of this PR. While `Tensor` may include them in the future, this PR does not\r\n2. This PR does not include a dimensionally dynamic `Tensor`.\r\n3. Performance: Since `Tensor` is defined using the `declare class` and classes that follow `Tensor` do so using the `implements` keyword, there are no runtime changes to `Tensor`-based classes.\r\n4. Bundle size: The JS bundle size will increase only by the size of the added functions (`isTensor`, `getTensorDimension`, etc.). The TS declaration size will also increase slightly due to `Tensor` and the added utility types.\r\n5. Maintenance: Since there is no implementation (just a class declaration), the extra maintenance is minimized to member signatures.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n*For the BabylonJS team concerning the PR*\r\n\r\n1. What other classes (e.g. `Size`) would be included and standardized?\r\n\r\n## FAQs\r\n\r\n#### What use cases does this proposal have?\r\n\r\n`Tensor` is not intended to be used by users. It is meant for internal organization and standardization. The functions (`isTensor`, `getTensorDimension`, etc.) are intended to be public and may be used by users. Their use cases may be inferred from their descriptions.\r\n\r\n#### What is the difference between this and #13699?\r\n\r\nThe capabilities of the type. `Vector` supports any **rank 1** tensor. `Tensor` generalizes `Vector`, and supports *any* rank tensor. A mathematical vector can be represented as `number[]`. A mathematical tensor can be represented as a `number`, `number[]`, `number[][]`, and so on. This table highlights the capability:\r\n\r\n | tensor rank | TS representation | BJS class (if exists) |\r\n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\r\n| 1 | `number[]` | `Vector` |\r\n| 1 | `[number, number]` | `Vector2` |\r\n| 1 | `[number, number, number]` | `Vector3`, `Color3` |\r\n| 1 | `[number, number, number, number]` | `Vector4`, `Color4`, `Quaternion` |\r\n| 2 | `number[][]` | `Matrix` |\r\n| 3 | `number[][][]` | |\r\n| 4 | `number[][][][]` | |\r\n| N | `TensorValue` | |\r\n\r\n####  How is incompatibility managed? Are incompatible classes dropped or are they modified to follow `Tensor`?\r\n\r\nAny classes included will be modified to follow the standard. In many cases, the diverging behavior makes the engine difficult to use, and changing the claseses to follow the `Tensor` standard benefits end users.\r\n\r\n## Further reading\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#user-content-footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-1\">1</a>. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor \r\n<a href=\"#user-content-footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-2\">2</a>. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension",

When a `.babylon` file is created with a `TargetCamera` and reimported, the camera will imported using the default behavior (creating a `UniversalCamera`).  The fix here is to add a NodeConstructor to handle instances of `TargetCameras`",

For example, using vite, this will work:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// index.js\r\n\r\nimport wasm from \"@babylonjs/dependencies/draco/draco_decoder_gltf.wasm?arraybuffer\"; // also works from \"draco3dgltf\" package\r\nimport { AutoReleaseWorkerPool } from \"@babylonjs/core/Misc/workerPool.js\";\r\nimport { DracoCompression } from \"@babylonjs/core/Meshes/Compression/dracoCompression.js\";\r\nimport { initializeWebWorker } from \"@babylonjs/core/Meshes/Compression/dracoCompressionWorker.js\";\r\nimport { Tools } from \"@babylonjs/core/Misc/tools.js\";\r\nimport { VertexBuffer } from \"@babylonjs/core/Meshes/buffer.js\";\r\n\r\nconst workerPool = new AutoReleaseWorkerPool(4, () => {\r\n  const worker = new Worker(new URL(\"./worker.js\", import.meta.url), {\r\n    type: \"module\",\r\n  });\r\n  return initializeWebWorker(worker, wasm);\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst dracoCompression = new DracoCompression({\r\n  workerPool,\r\n});\r\n\r\n// worker.js\r\nimport { workerFunction } from \"@babylonjs/core/Meshes/Compression/dracoCompressionWorker.js\";\r\nimport \"@babylonjs/dependencies/draco/draco_decoder_gltf.js\";\r\n\r\nworkerFunction();\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows each build system to decide the architecture they want to use, as long as they provide the correct data.\r\n* Providing URLs is still possible, and is the simplest way to override the default babylon behavior. This method will also be present if it is impossible\r\n* The ***Worker.ts files are not exported to UMD! So they will only be available to be used in @babylonjs/core . They will be available in UMD, but not exported.\r\n* This maintains back-compat and makes the least amount of changes\r\n* Only worker-enabled modules were changed. The rest can use the URL configuration instead of injecting, as every build system will provide a URL of an asset which can be used on the main thread. As workers work a bit differently it is required to provide this way of injecting them directly as well.\r\n\r\nWaiting for reviews!",

Currently, the gizmo is not displayed at the right location/orientation because it does not take into account the mesh on which the skeleton is attached (the gizmo is relative to the root of the skeleton). By setting `additionalTransformNode` to the mesh, the gizmo will be correctly displayed because we will multiply the final transform with the mesh transform.\r\n\r\nI also updated the inspector to use the new feature.\r\n\r\nTest PG (the gizmos should be at the location of the upper bone): https://playground.babylonjs.com/#HFWCMJ#26",

This reuses the same API that is used on desktop, so the experience can work on both desktop and XR. Note - no interaction is possible in XR (as this is a layer that is rendered on top of the XR environment)\n* Added the ability to add a quad XR layer. At the moment only internally, as I want to change the API and make sure we can easily support all other XR layer types.\n* Firefox reality is no longer a thing - removed code directly related to it.\n* Added hand tracking as an optional feature - this will allow devs to use the hand meshes directly instead of seeing the static default hand models.\n* Fix an issue where the baseLayer will be created twice when using XR Layers\n* Added a warning when attaching or detaching a feature didn't work as expected\n* Remodelled the internal architecture of WebXR layers, imrp\n* Small fixes for the webxr declaration\n* Moved WebXR composition layer implementation(s) to a new directory for structure. These are internal classes so it's not a breaking change.\n* Fixed an issue that is apparent when using the webxr emulator\n* made small changes to the session manager's architecture.\n* fixed an issue with clearing when in multiview mode and in layers\n",

When option `doNotInjectCode=false`, BJS will log error in dev tool console about missing shader includes by default. The reason is BJS does not yet have full support for StandardMaterial or PBRMaterial implemented in WGSL. It is a lot of work to setup WGSL shader from scratch with transparent shadows, self shadow, etc to test the missing shader includes for shadow map. The idea is: for now, if a developer has implement a complete WGSL shader that require these shader includes, this developer can create these shader includes in WGSL, and include them in ShaderStore.IncludesShadersStoreWGSL. [This example](https://github.com/shen-lin/Babylon.js/blob/wgls-dev/packages/tools/devHost/src/createScene.ts#L30) has been tested with some dumm WGSL code included into final runtime WGSL shader. If I later on need these shader includes and I have a test case, I will implement them and add to BJS WGSL shader include.\r\n\r\nThe shader includes that could be added in the future (WGSL version) mentioned above refers to:\r\n- shadowMapVertexExtraDeclaration\r\n- shadowMapVertexNormalBias\r\n- shadowMapVertexMetric\r\n- shadowMapFragmentSoftTransparentShadow\r\n- shadowMapFragment\r\n\r\n### Example outcome\r\n\r\nSee [dev branch](https://github.com/shen-lin/Babylon.js/tree/wgls-dev) for test scenario setup in dev host.\r\n\r\nScreenshot of local test result as shown below. A WGSL vertex shader is applied to animate both sphere and shadow vertex displacement.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-01-30 at 4 26 19 PM](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/assets/4505448/9fc6146b-2ee9-4be5-b15d-020115759512)\r\n\r\n",

                "description": "This PR wraps these three Havok functionalities into methods on the plugin.\r\n\r\nPoint Proximity takes a IPointProximityQuery and stores its results in a ContactPoint representing the closest point on a body.\r\nShape Proximity takes a IShapeProximityQuery and stores its results in two ContactPoints, representing the hit point in shape space and world space.\r\nShape Cast takes a IShapeCastQuery and stores its results in two ContactPoints, representing the hit point in shape space and world space.\r\n\r\nI'd love feedback here if the API and naming looks all right 🙂 One thing I'm not sure of is the `hitDistance` name in the ContactPoint class. For point prox and shape prox, it does really represent the distance to the hit point, but in the case of the shape cast, it is a fraction along the cast ray. So the name doesn't really describe it, but I'm not sure if it warrants a new class just to have a different name, or if there's a better name that works with both notions. I initially wanted to reuse the PhysicsRaycastResult class, but that also didn't work because that class has `hitPoint*World*` and one of the hit points is not in world space for shape prox/shape cast.\r\n\r\nHere's some Playground examples:\r\nPoint Proximity: #I6AR8X#21\r\nShape Proximity: #1VT1BK#11\r\nShape Cast: #1VT1BK#12\r\n\r\n",

If non-zero, we compile the shader with `NUM_MORPH_INFLUENCERS=this value`, and `NUM_MORPH_INFLUENCERS` is used as the upper bound of a loop over the targets. We use a uniform variable to break from the loop when we reach the number of active targets.\r\n\r\nNote that for WebGPU / WGSL, up to now, we didn't have a mean to make preprocessing variable replacements (we didn't need it)! When defining something like `#define TEST 23`, `TEST` could be used in a `#if` / `#ifdef` / `#elif` statement, but not as a replacement like in `int test = TEST;`. It works in WebGL because such replacements are automatically handled by the GLSL parser/compiler (there's no specific code in Babylon to do it).\r\n\r\nSo, I added this feature in WebGPU, but the replacement variable name should be enclosed inside $...$ (I can change the enclosing character!). I did it this way because I think this code would be too time consuming:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst defineToValue: { [key: string]: string } = {};\r\n// fill defineToValue with the replacement variables\r\ncode.replace(/(\\w+)/g, (_, p1) => {\r\n    return defineToValue[p1] ?? p1;\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThis would mean hundred or thousand (or more!) of replacements (because `(\\w+)` will match a lot of time) + the possibility of wrong replacements (in case a replacement variable is a subset of a string).",

                "description": "When sound playback fails, the `Sound` class assumes the browser's audio context is suspended and waiting for user interaction, so it locks the audio engine and shows the unmute button. In the case of streaming sounds, playback fails in Chrome with `DOMException: The play method is not allowed by the user agent` ... **but the audio context is not suspended**. Since the audio engine assumes the audio context is `suspended`, the current `AudioEngine.unlock()` implementation fails when the audio context state is actually `running`.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes the `AudioEngine.unlock()` issue by setting `AudioEngine.unlocked` to `true` and notifying `onAudioUnlockedObservable` observers when the audio context state is `running`.\r\n\r\nTested on playground https://playground.babylonjs.com/#BB4105#1.",

                "description": "Fixes #12441\n\nThe webxr session manager now has a world scaling factor that allows to set the units in which your world is defined. i.e., if, in your world, 1 unit is 1 cm, you would define the factor to be 100. the native XR component will still maintain the 1 unit 1 meter relation, but the data from and to XR are scaled correctly according to the scale factor.\n\nControllers and hands are scaled as well. So is the teleportation ring.\n\nNote - any other values should be scaled by the dev itself. For example, the ray's distance will be in world scale. Another example - to define gestures for the hands components you would need to use the components' absolute position and scale the distances accordingly.",

Four sampler2D textures are used to store `covA`, `covB`, `centers`, and `colors`. These textures will not be changed after initialization.\r\n2. `splatIndex` attribute are used to store the sorting index of splats, and it is the only instance attribute to be changed after each sorting.\r\n3. positions are only post to worker once, only `_modelViewMatrix` is updated often\r\n\r\nWith the modification above, [large dataset](https://projects.markkellogg.org/threejs/assets/data/truck/truck_high.ksplat) could be rendered with fps 60, which is originally around 15.",

This is useful for some glTF extensions, such as Interactivity and Animation Pointer. For example, an Animation Pointer path, such as `/nodes/0/translation` is converted to a list of AnimationProperty objects which are used to construct a Babylon animation.\r\n\r\nThis translation is performed by the implementers of an interface IPathToObjectConverter, whose method `convert` takes a path and returns this special object. There are three implementations of it. One (FlowGraphPathConverter) is aimed to resolve paths in the FlowGraphContext, and two are aimed to resolve glTF paths.\r\n\r\nAs part of this change, the existing FlowGraphPath class was deleted, as its functionality is superseded by the FlowGraphPathConverter class. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the KHR_animation_pointer class was slightly tweaked to use its path converter.",

At the time, only Canary supports it. You must enable the feature at runtime by doing `engine.enableGPUTimingMeasurements = true` (will do nothing in WebGL of course!).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/assets/4152247/e06e6beb-9ea1-4b5b-a5e2-008b69cb8385)\r\n\r\nI also performed some changes so that we don't generate errors for mapped buffers when the device is destroyed.\r\n",

The rest of the math nodes will be added later.\r\n- GetProperty node was added.\r\n- Some nodes had input values moved to configuration values, such as the GetVariable node.",

It's a bit ugly but creating another function was the only way I could see to avoid duplicating lots of code.\r\nTo mimic the dispersion effect, I compute the refraction coords 3 times with slightly different IOR's and then sample the environment refraction with each of these. The final refraction is a combination of R from the first, G from the second and B from the last.\r\n<img width=\"670\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-07 at 4 26 55 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/assets/1069125/34daa5bb-7225-4014-8bae-8c35c75392b8\">\r\n",

With this, picking a child mesh will lead to any of its parents' picks also being fired. The ordering is that first the child mesh event fires, then the parents, no matter in what order the event blocks were added to the graph. For this, when we start a graph, we need to recompute the order where the event blocks fire for each context. The reordering is done so that, if two FlowGraphMeshPickEventBlocks appear in the ordering, the first one's referenced mesh is a descendant of the second one's reference mesh.",

The main reason this warning should be displayed is in cases where it is not possible to determine the sizes of all controls inside the StackPanel by using just the controls themselves and their children. I'm calling \"fully defined\" the width/height of controls that can be determined using just the size of the control and its children - i.e, the control doesn't depend on its parent for sizing. A regular Control would be fully defined if its size is expressed in pixels instead of percentage. And a Container control would be fully defined if it has `adaptWidth/HeightToChildren` set to true and all its children are fully defined. For a StackPanel, we want its width (in horizontal mode) or height (in vertical mode) to be fully defined, because they adapt to their children. So we display the warning when the corresponding dimension is not fully defined. I didn't reword the warning itself because I couldn't think of a better phrasing, but it might be good to change the phrasing too.",

                "title": "Flow graph path",
                "description": "# Changes\r\nA new class called `FlowGraphPath` was introduced. The intention behind this class is to serve as a generic implementation of the glTF Object Model (https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/d8c3ef5bd9e2054e2caff34c99103953aa29a610/specification/2.0/ObjectModel.adoc), as assets in the interactivity extension are referenced by this model. The path will be resolved against the user variables in the Flow Graph's context. For example, given a context with\r\n```javascript\r\nconst context = new FlowGraphContext(...);\r\ncontext._userVariables = {\r\n a: [ { b: 1 } ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen, `a/0/b` would resolve to the value \"1\". The dot also works as an separator, so `a/0.b` should also resolve to \"1\".\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to perform runtime substitutions with numeric values on these paths. One example would be `a/{runTimeValue}/b`, where `runTimeValue` can be substituted for any number. The string \"runTimeValue\" is called a \"template string\", and nodes created with paths containing template strings will have an input connection for each of these values. A concrete example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst block = new FlowGraphSetPropertyBlock({path: new FlowGraphPath(\"/a/{runTimeValue}/b\")});\r\nblock.getDataInput(\"runTimeValue\").setValue(0, ... );\r\n```\r\nThen, at run-time, the value of the \"runTimeValue\" input would be evaluated, and the string `a/{runTimeValue}/b` resolved as `a/0/b`. Using template strings wouldn't make much sense in this example, as I could just have created the path with the final value I wanted, but if the \"runTimeValue\" input is connected to other data nodes, then we have the dynamic resolution of assets.\r\n\r\nBesides the SetProperty block, other blocks that utilize paths are PlayAnimation and MeshPick. MeshPick is a little special because it is an Event Block - meaning it shouldn't depend on arbitrary input data to function (at least from my understanding - this can be discussed). In this case, it shouldn't receive paths with template strings.\r\n\r\n[EDIT: NEW ADDITION]\r\nTo simplify the common pattern of generating numeric data inputs from a path, and getting those values and substituting them in the path, a new class named FlowGraphPathComponent was added. This class is intended to be a member of blocks that realize this pattern, such as SetProperty or PlayAnimation. So, for example, in the SetProperty constructor:\r\n```javascript\r\npublic constructor(public config: IFlowGraphSetPropertyBlockConfiguration) {\r\n        super(config);\r\n\r\n        this.value = this.registerDataInput(\"value\", RichTypeAny);\r\n        this.templateComponent = new FlowGraphPathComponent(config.path, this);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand in execute:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\npublic _execute(context: FlowGraphContext): void {\r\n        const value = this.value.getValue(context);\r\n        const path = this.templateComponent.substitutePath(context);\r\n        path.setProperty(context, value);\r\n\r\n        this.onDone._activateSignal(context);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome additional changes that ended up being made: on the FlowGraphContext, I switched the `_userVariables`, `_executionVariables`, etc, i.e, the Map values, to be simple Records. The reason for that is just making the nested access in _userVariables easier, and the others were changed to keep the same style. It should have a bonus of not having any overhead from the Map class. \r\n\r\n# Examples\r\nSome PGs that use the paths:\r\n- #KSTQJU#9 - SetProperty with path: click on the left sphere and the right sphere will change position\r\n- #KSTQJU#10 - SetProperty with template string\r\n- #KSTQJU#11 - MeshPick and SetProperty with template string\r\n- #KSTQJU#13 - MeshPick and PlayAnimation with template string\r\n- #GPPEUA#11 - Car semaphore example\r\n",

We will have to wait for an extension that allows to raise this  limit before re-enabling it.\r\n* With the latest version of Chrome (119), I also had to handle depth textures in much the same way as float textures when linear filtering is not supported for them: the sampler type must be forced to \"unfilterable float\" for depth textures in the bind group layout.\r\n* The \"float32-filtering\" extension is now supported by Chrome, which revealed some bugs I had to fix in the code (I had to create a new \"supportFloatTexturesResolve\" caps because WebGPU can currently render to a R32float but not resolve it).\r\n* I fixed a bug with greased lines, which didn't work in WebGPU.\r\n* I've added the visualization tests I used specifically for WebGPU to the regular list (in `config.json`), as it's no problem to have them for WebGL too.",

                "description": "This PR modifies all cameras to take the animation ratio (time to complete a single frame) and uses it to make all camera movements take the same amount of time as 60 FPS (AR of 1).\r\n\r\nUpdate: Since the animation ratio (ratio used to scale inertia and movement offsets) is only updated in `scene.render()`, we had to add a custom timing method for users that have a custom rendering loop/cadence.  This PR also adds the following changes:\r\n\r\n- `PrecisionDate.Now` has been updated to be more efficient\r\n- The variable `constantAnimationDeltaTime` has been added so that users can change the delta time for testing purposes\r\n\r\nPGs Used to Test: \r\n- https://playground.babylonjs.com/#DLIIMQ\r\n- https://playground.babylonjs.com/#DLIIMQ#1\r\n- https://playground.babylonjs.com/#DLIIMQ#3\r\n- https://playground.babylonjs.com/#DLIIMQ#4\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: Because we're now using 1000 / 60 (16.6666...) instead of 16 for the default constant animation ratio, some of the particle tests were broke.  I've updated the PNGs against the new ratio.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the camera to move correctly, regardless of frame rate, I had to create a scaling factor that has to be multiplied against the offsets to be added.  Because the math isn't quite clear as to how the scaling factor is found, here's an explanation:\r\n\r\nGiven the following variables:\r\n**r = initial offset\r\nn = inertia\r\na = relative inertia (with respect to frame deltaTime ratio; currentDeltaTime/standardDeltaTime) = n^t\r\ns = scale factor\r\nt = deltaTime ratio = currentDeltaTime/standardDeltaTime**\r\n\r\nLet's assume that the work to be done for our current frame rate can be represented as `scaleFactor * initial offset * relative inertia` `(inertia ^ (currentDeltaTime/standardDeltaTime))`.  The equivalent amount of time could be represented as the sum _from (1 to t)_ of our `initial offset * inertia^x`\r\nsra = rn^t + ... + rn\r\n\r\nIf we factor out a common value of `rn`, we then have our initial value * the sum of a geometric series.\r\nsra = rn(n^(t-1) + ... + 1)\r\n\r\nWe can also factor out our initial offset\r\nsa = n(n^(t-1) + ... + 1)\r\n\r\nNext, we can substitute the closed formula for the sum of a geometric series\r\nsa = n((n^t - 1) / (n - 1))\r\n\r\nFinally, we set everything equal to s\r\ns = n((n^t - 1) / (n - 1)) / a\r\n\r\nLet's substitute a for n^t and clean up the fractions a bit\r\ns = n * (1/a) * ((a - 1) / (n - 1))\r\n**s = (n/a) * ((a - 1) / (n - 1))**",

                "description": "This PR modifies all cameras to take the animation ratio (time to complete a single frame) and uses it to make all camera movements take the same amount of time as 60 FPS (AR of 1).\r\n\r\nUpdate: Since the animation ratio (ratio used to scale inertia and movement offsets) is only updated in `scene.render()`, we had to add a custom timing method for users that have a custom rendering loop/cadence.  This PR also adds the following changes:\r\n\r\n- `PrecisionDate.Now` has been updated to be more efficient\r\n- The variable `constantAnimationDeltaTime` has been added so that users can change the delta time for testing purposes\r\n\r\nPGs Used to Test: \r\n- https://playground.babylonjs.com/#DLIIMQ\r\n- https://playground.babylonjs.com/#DLIIMQ#1\r\n- https://playground.babylonjs.com/#DLIIMQ#3\r\n- https://playground.babylonjs.com/#DLIIMQ#4\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: Because we're now using 1000 / 60 (16.6666...) instead of 16 for the default constant animation ratio, some of the particle tests were broke.  I've updated the PNGs against the new ratio.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the camera to move correctly, regardless of frame rate, I had to create a scaling factor that has to be multiplied against the offsets to be added.  Because the math isn't quite clear as to how the scaling factor is found, here's an explanation:\r\n\r\nGiven the following variables:\r\n**r = initial offset\r\nn = inertia\r\na = relative inertia (with respect to frame deltaTime ratio; currentDeltaTime/standardDeltaTime) = n^t\r\ns = scale factor\r\nt = deltaTime ratio = currentDeltaTime/standardDeltaTime**\r\n\r\nLet's assume that the work to be done for our current frame rate can be represented as `scaleFactor * initial offset * relative inertia` `(inertia ^ (currentDeltaTime/standardDeltaTime))`.  The equivalent amount of time could be represented as the sum _from (1 to t)_ of our `initial offset * inertia^x`\r\nsra = rn^t + ... + rn\r\n\r\nIf we factor out a common value of `rn`, we then have our initial value * the sum of a geometric series.\r\nsra = rn(n^(t-1) + ... + 1)\r\n\r\nWe can also factor out our initial offset\r\nsa = n(n^(t-1) + ... + 1)\r\n\r\nNext, we can substitute the closed formula for the sum of a geometric series\r\nsa = n((n^t - 1) / (n - 1))\r\n\r\nFinally, we set everything equal to s\r\ns = n((n^t - 1) / (n - 1)) / a\r\n\r\nLet's substitute a for n^t and clean up the fractions a bit\r\ns = n * (1/a) * ((a - 1) / (n - 1))\r\n**s = (n/a) * ((a - 1) / (n - 1))**",

For example, if the subString is `nodeIndex`, and the path is `/node/{nodeIndex}/`, when this node is activated, it will look into the nodeIndex socket, and substitute its value (which could be 0, then the path would be `/node/0`). This allows dynamic paths that are resolved based on the current state of the scene.\r\n   - This change will be needed because of how the glTF Interactivity uses paths. In some cases, paths are defined as `/node/{nodeIndex}/property`, and we want these paths to be resolved at runtime.\r\n-  The SetProperty node was changed to use a configuration object instead of sockets. The configuration object contains a string path (as defined in the context variables), and a string property, such as translation, rotation, etc.\r\n- I also moved the default serialization and parsing functions to a separate module, and added handling of vector values.\r\n- I also removed the variableDefinitions value, as it wasn't being used and made things more complex.",

                "description": "I added the support as a whole and not to WebGPU specifically, this way it can benefit to any engine that requires that strides be a multiple of 4 bytes (like probably Native does).\r\n\r\nIf the stride is not a multiple of 4 bytes, each time you call `VertexBuffer.update()`, it will create a new GPU buffer. But calling `VertexBuffer.update()` is slow anyway, because we must create a new buffer on the js side to make space for padding data. So, I prefered not to handle this case and simply create a new GPU buffer instead of making the PR more complex. If necessary, we can update the docs to explain what happens with non aligned strides and how to handle it on the user side.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] Ready for review again!",

This is used, for example, in the \"multiGate\" block to configure how many outputs the block has.\r\n- It also adds a getClassName function for all blocks (and I'm very sorry for the size the PR ended up with 😢 )\r\n- It also adds all the blocks to the class register\r\n- Removed the CustomFunctionBlock since it's not on the spec and I was just using it for tests. Instead now I'm using the Log block and mocking the console.log function\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n- Serialize: #KSTQJU#3\r\n- Parse: #CVDC94#2",

                "description": "I've added `Mesh.renderWithRenderPassId` to make it easier to render an entire mesh without having to loop through sub-meshes by hand. If you provide a render pass ID, this is a useful method for rendering a mesh multiple times in a frame.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I used to reply to forum posts, when a specific rendering effect required a mesh to be rendered multiple times per frame, that the mesh needed to be cloned. In fact, using render pass IDs solves the problem neatly: simply create a new render pass ID and use it to assign the material you want to use to render your mesh a second time! The helper method simplifies this scheme by allowing you to perform the additional rendering in a single call.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n* Mesh cloning: https://playground.babylonjs.com/#QDAZ80#207\r\n* Use of a render pass id + helper method: https://playground.babylonjs.com/#QDAZ80#506\r\n\r\nI'd have preferred to call it `render`, but this method already exists (and draws a sub-mesh)...\r\n\r\nThis PR also makes a small change to `Tools.FloatRound`. I've checked that `Math.fround` is supported by all the browsers we're targeting (it wasn't supported by IE11 only, for which we dropped support some time ago), so it's a small performance improvement to remove the `if` condition.",

Any excess beyond the container, like a plane attached the texture with one `TextBlock`,  will not be displayed.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, when I set the `fontSize`, `width` and `resizeToFit` simultaneously, it's `width` to fit `fontSize`, rather `fontSize` to fit `width`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet text = new BABYLON.GUI.TextBlock();\r\ntext.text = \"Hello world\";\r\ntext.fontSize = 50;\r\ntext.width = 0.5\r\ntext.resizeToFit = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n**It's all about the content.** There's nothing about the `container` or `to fit container`.\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, the original version is kind of ambiguous to understand.

                "description": "This is a refactor that will eventually enable a serializer like GLTFExporter to use the now core-based `GetTextureDataAsync` in order to serialize textures that are not directly retrievable as RGBA e.g., GPU-compressed formats.\r\n\r\nFor more discussion on that point, see #12257. The part that is missing to ultimately solve this is some sort of function or BaseTexture-property that can tell whether the texture uses a GPU compressed format. Once that exists, then it should be easy to do something like this... from `glTFMaterialExporter.ts`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/assets/20366429/21df00fc-a5b4-4ed5-a735-5f9d984bb54a)\r\n\r\n",

This is because, if we have the same graph running with multiple contexts, the value of a data connection can be different between them. I wasn't differentiating them before, which was an oversight.\r\n\r\n- When a block executes, it now knows which of its input signals activated the block. This is needed for blocks that have a \"reset\" input, such as some of the conditional blocks added.\r\n\r\n# Example PGs\r\n \r\n- #RKQX23#10: DoN - Click on the sphere to log a message max 5 times, click on the box to reset the DoN counter\r\n- #BWRXG9#2: Throttle - Log a message every 3 seconds using onTick event and Throttle, click on the sphere to reset the throttle\r\n- #RKQX23#7: Multigate - without looping, click on the sphere to log the number of execution\r\n- #RKQX23#8: Multigate - with looping, click on the sphere to log the number of execution\r\n- #RKQX23#9: Multigate - with looping and randomizing, click on the sphere to log the number of execution\r\n- #RKQX23#6: Switch - Change the switch's value on the code\r\n- #J1N2GP#5: Wait all - Click on the 3 spheres to open the door, click on the box to reset the wait all count\r\n- #9C7VK6#1: Counter - Log the value on the counter after a delay, explore the value in two different contexts \r\n- #5JFH79#7: While loop - Logs from 1 to 5",

The old function decodes to `VertexData` which requires floats. This is slow if the Draco data has non-float data.\r\n- Update `VertexBuffer` class to allow passing null to engine to support scenarios where the buffer is just being used for manipulating data. This is used in the old `decodeMeshAsync` to convert the non-float data to float data.\r\n- Update `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` loader to use new `decodeMeshToGeometryAsync`.\r\n- Update Draco dist to official 1.5.6 (this isn't required but might as well) and remove instructions to build a custom IE version as we don't support IE anymore.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the assets from #11685 are not proper. As [noted](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/issues/11685#issuecomment-1000350051) by @Popov72, the Draco decoder decodes the data with normalized being false when it is supposed to be true. It only works in three.js because it uses the information from glTF. We shouldn't rely on glTF information as Draco data is supposed to be self-contained. The mannequin asset from the forum correctly decodes with normalized being true.",

To centralize the listening and notifying of events, a new class was added, named FlowGraphEventCoordinator. Multiple Flow Graphs can share the same Event Coordinator and with that, communicate with each other through events. \r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n#J1N2GP#1 -> click on the sphere, the door opening animation will play\r\n#GPPEUA#5 -> click on the green button, the animation plays. Click on the red button, the animation stops.\r\n#MD0K3B -> click on the button, the two spheres will move up\r\n\r\nOn the three cases, the button and the acted upon object have distinct graphs, and communicate through a custom event.",

                "description": "## Changes:\r\n- Added the idea of a \"context\" of a graph, that is created by `graph.createContext`, and is used for both user variables , block-scoped execution variables (such as the current index of a for loop block), graph-scoped execution variables (such as the scene the graph runs in), and also to keep a list of blocks with pending tasks. When blocks execute, they pass the context down to the next block.\r\n- GetVariable and SetVariable blocks\r\n- Conditional data and conditional execution block. The former returns a value depending on a condition and the latter executes a flow depending on a condition.\r\n- PlayAnimation Block \r\n- SetProperty Block\r\n- Timer Block, it can execute an action immediately and another action after a delay\r\n- Data connection points now receive a RichType instead of a default value. A RichType follows an interface containing the name of the type (which can be useful for displaying different colors depending of type on the visual tool), and a function to generate a default value of the type. \r\n- A connection point is now able to connect to multiple other points depending on its type, as follows:\r\n    - Data output blocks can connect to MULTIPLE points, since a piece of data can be used by many blocks.\r\n    - Data input blocks can only connect to ONE point, because a block has to have a well defined source of data.\r\n    - Signal output blocks can only connect to ONE point, because a block can only execute one well defined flow after it.\r\n    - Signal input blocks can connect to MULTIPLE points, since the same flow can be executed from multiple antecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example PGs:\r\n- #43USDV#4 -> once the scene starts, runs a for loop and log its index \r\n- #43USDV#3 -> click on the sphere or on the cube, it will run a for loop and log its index \r\n- #GQAXFL#7 -> click on the sphere or on the cube, it will immediately change color to red, and 1s later change color to yellow\r\n- #GQAXFL#5 -> click on the sphere or on the cube and each will run a different animation. you can press \"p\" to dispose of the graph",

This can be observed in this PG: https://playground.babylonjs.com/#7DMWP8#574, where the same constraint is used for the two pairs of bodies and disposed of after 2s.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `_pluginData` object on the PhysicsConstraint to be an array, where each created joint reference is pushed, and updates the plugin methods accordingly.

This causes all subsequent calls to `AudioEngine._triggerRunningState()` to early out making it impossible to resume the audio context again.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes the issue by checking the `_tryToRun` flag. If it is `true` then the audio context is suspended and the `_tryToRun` flag is reset to `false` before attempting to resume the audio context.\r\n\r\nReported on forum: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/unmute-icon-remove/257/25\r\n\r\nTested on iOS using playground https://playground.babylonjs.com/#35VF39#3",

It's a set of `strings` instead of `TransformNode` / `Bone` / ... so that a single mask can be used for several animation groups.\r\n\r\nBy way of illustration, in the Avatar PoC, I can remove the custom functions `RemoveIdentityTransformationsFromAnimationGroup` and `RemoveTargetsFromAnimationGroup` and replace them with something like :\r\n```typescript\r\nconst animationGroupMask = new BABYLON.AnimationGroupMask([<list of bone names used by the facial animation>]);\r\n\r\nthis._facialAnimationGroup.mask = animationGroupMask;\r\nthis._facialAnimationGroup.removeUnmaskedAnimations();\r\n```\r\nThere's no hurry to review the PR, so don't bother if you're on vacation!",

The plugin no longer stores the options object, and instead unwraps each property of option into its own direct plugin property.\r\n\r\nIt also means I can remove the serialize/parse methods, applying the serialization decorator to each property instead.\r\n\r\n(I did look into making a new decorator for custom objects, but I don't know enough about TS metaprogramming to make it in time!)",

Ultimately it produces a geometry but with a procedural approach\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n- The cost of downloading assets on the web is a strong limiting factor and procedural data can help solve that by limiting the download to the core pieces that are assembled later on by the NodeGeometry system (Example PG: #PYY6XE#59)\r\n- The system is dynamic and can produce an infinity of variants. Far above what an offline source can produce (think about terrain generation or vegetation generation).\r\n- It allows a new way of modelling by assembling core shapes and playing around with a node system",

This ensures that the engine would only match complete words, not substrings within longer words or comments.\r\n\r\nThe regular expressions have been updated as follows: \r\n````\r\nconst outRegex = /(flat\\s)?\\s*\\bout\\b /;\r\nconst inRegex = /(flat\\s)?\\s*\\bin\\b /;\r\nconst varyingRegex = /(flat\\s)?\\s*\\bvarying\\b/ ;\r\n````\r\n\r\n",

So, every time you stop and restart an animation group, you have to call `AnimationGroup.setWeightForAllAnimatables(weight)` if you want to set a blend weight.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `weight` property that you can set at any time, as well as the ability to pass the weight as a parameter at construction time.\r\n\r\nCloses #https://github.com/BabylonJS/ThePirateCove/issues/540\r\n",

                "description": "Hello first let me explain the bug I found.\r\n\r\n- The `Bone.returnToRest()` method performs `this._matrix = this._restMatrix;` when there is no `_linkedTransformNode`.\r\nhttps://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/packages/dev/core/src/Bones/bone.ts#L322\r\n\r\n- And the 'rest matrix' is compared to the 'local matrix', and if the two are the same, the matrix update is canceled.\r\nhttps://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/packages/dev/core/src/Bones/bone.ts#L70-L80\r\n\r\nHowever, if the local matrix needs to be composed (which means the local matrix is out of date), comparing the local matrix with the pose matrix is problematic.\r\n\r\nHere's the specific code that causes the bug.\r\n```typescript\r\n// First, call returnToRest to make the localMatrix and restMetrix the same.\r\nbone.returnToRest();\r\n\r\n// then executes code that can replace the values of _localPosition, _localRotation, or _localScaling.\r\n// The local matrix is now out of date and requires a compose.\r\nbone.setPosition(new Vector3(1, 2, 3), Space.LOCAL);\r\n\r\n// Then the _localPosition_ has changed, but the localMatrix and restMatrix are still the same,\r\n// so this code does not work properly.\r\nbone.returnToRest();\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, you can check the equality comparison with _needToCompose. (May not be the best way)\r\nSo this is what the modified code looks like this:\r\n```typescript\r\nset _matrix(value: Matrix) {\r\n    // skip if the matrices are the same\r\n    if (value.updateFlag === this._localMatrix.updateFlag && !this._needToCompose) {\r\n        this._needToCompose = false; // in case there was a pending compose\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    this._needToCompose = false; // in case there was a pending compose\r\n\r\n    this._localMatrix.copyFrom(value);\r\n    this._markAsDirtyAndDecompose();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe method `Bone.updateMatrix` also has the same problem because it uses the `_matrix` property.\r\n\r\nI would like to mention someone who I think would be knowledgeable about this issue. If I mention someone incorrectly, I apologize in advance.\r\n@Popov72 ",

                "description": "Allows MESH and CONVEX_HULL shapes to be constructed from TransformNode or InstancedMesh instances and  correctly account for transform of children when includeChildMeshes is set to true.\r\n\r\nDiscussed this with @carolhmj - there were a couple of failure cases or unexpected behaviour when building physics shapes.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of one of the failure cases (check the console logs): https://playground.babylonjs.com/#5BJIYA#3 - this loads a glTF file which contains a mesh with multiple materials. The loader will create a single TransformNode with two Mesh children - one for each material.  If a user tries to build a physics shape from the \"Cube\" object (which is a glTF mesh, but a Babylon TransformNode) they'll hit the failure cases in the console.log()s. Similarly, if the mesh was instanced multiple times, the old code previously tried to use an `InstancedMesh` instance as if it were a `Mesh`, which would raise an exception accessing an undefined property (`Mesh.getVerticesData`)\r\n\r\nThis change allows a user to create a single physics shape from this scene construct. I've also tested this with some additional playground scenes, which @carolhmj linked me to:\r\n\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#5BJIYA#4\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#K7TJIG#363\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#9T64J6\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#R9DTZ0#16\r\n\r\nAnd made a new variant of one, which tests this includeChildMeshes functionality in the complicated \"Buggy\" asset:\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#K7TJIG#371\r\n\r\nSince I can imagine that this case of constructing a single physics shape from a whole branch of the scene hierarchy is useful, it would probably also be nice to expose the includeChildMeshes property to the PhysicsShapeMesh and PhysicsShapeConvexHull constructors, without having to require users use the PhysicsShape base class.",

                "description": "A user in the forum found an issue where having an active SpriteManager was interfering with picking being done when `scene.constantlyUpdateMeshUnderPointer` is set to true.  This PR makes two small changes.  First, because of how the SpriteManager works, lazy picking cannot be applied so if there's an active SpriteManager, lazy picking isn't used.  Second, if the `scene.constantlyUpdateMeshUnderPointer` is set to true, lazy picking will also be disabled as the mesh under the pointer will not be updated normally until the property is accessed.\r\n\r\nA test has also been added to verify that picking is done before the picking info is referenced under these specific circumstances.",

                "description": "In my scene with 50+ shaders the ShaderDefineExpression.infixToPostfix was called 15 000–35 000 times while scene is loading. In average for one loading it takes 54.28ms for all calls and 34.39ms for first 15 000 calls.\r\nAfter optimized from this PR I achieve next result: 9.68ms for all calls and 7.09ms for first 15 000 calls.\r\n\r\nI made two simple changes:\r\n1. If `infix` does not contain operators, then it will not be modified, so we can return it as is.\r\n2. As I mention above this function called thousands times while scene loading. But the input string are not unique every time, in fact, in my case, it was only 168 unique infixes. So there is a reason to use memoization, because the result of this function deterministic and has no side effects as I can see.\r\nFor safety work with memory I add a limit for memoize cache as 50000 entries. In my case the 100 entries takes 6504 chars of memory, so with the basic interpolation it might be around 640 KB for 50 000 entries. As all we know, 640K ought to be enough for anybody :)\r\n\r\nSo, just with this two changes  performance of the function was boosted 5.6x times and for my middle (as I think now) scene it saves 45ms (or almost 3 frames) for loading.",

                "description": "I have a pretty big scene (100+ meshed, 50+ shaders) in glb format, when it loaded the loop in the `ShaderProcessor._ProcessIncludes()` was called 4927 times, and takes 200.57 ms and each loop take 0.0407ms. This values bases on 30 runs.\r\nAfter performance optimzations I got next result — the loop calls 3955 times, takes 70.82ms for all calls and 0.0179ms per one loop.\r\n\r\n1. I make regex as a static fields to avoid builing it in runtime.\r\n2. Change string replaces from regex to regular string where it possible.\r\n3. Replace while loop to for-of to avoid uneccessary `.exec()` at end of while-loop.\r\n4. Replace very heavy string replace opertation to `parts.join(\"\")` (more then 2x boost here)\r\n5. Fix warning from `new String()`.\r\n\r\nEvery change puts in a single commit.\r\n\r\nFor future discussing - we also can change this part:\r\n```ts\r\nfor (let index = 0; index < splits.length; index += 2) {\r\n    const source = new RegExp(splits[index], \"g\");\r\n    const dest = splits[index + 1];\r\n    includeContent = includeContent.replace(source, dest);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith `.replaceAll` and save 5-7ms for all loading time (it would be 65ms for all calls in my case). But now I can't use it because `TS2550: Property 'replaceAll' does not exist on type 'string'. Do you need to change your target library? Try changing the 'lib' compiler option to 'es2021' or later.`",

This PR allows that the target position can also be set to the pivot point of the attached node (If it is an instance of `TransformNode`). This mainly increases the usability of the `RotationGizmo` since it will stay in place during the rotation if a custom pivot point was defined.\r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\nI tested it for all Gizmos (position, rotation, scale, boundingBox) with different settings (`updateScale`, `updateGizmoPositionToMatchAttachedMesh`, custom mesh pivot). The only thing I noticed is that `BoundingBoxGizmo` does not work probably with a custom pivot point.

Avoid regex test, when it need with simple condition with `indexOf(\"#\")`.\r\n\r\nWhy I made it. I has a pretty big scene, where by my performance tracker to the `_MoveCursor` was detected 51475 call times.\r\nI had 16 measurements and it takes from 31 to 58 ms for my scene for all calls, and 44.73ms for all measurements in average.\r\n\r\nThen I tried to move regex into static field, then I had 13 runs of my measurement tool and now `_MoveCursor` takes 40.74ms in average for same 51475 calls.\r\n\r\nThen I add condition with `indexOf(\"#\")` and for 18 runs the `_MoveCursor` takes 28.67ms in average.\r\n\r\nOne improtant moment: I don't now how to test this changes. I see that ShaderProcessor does not have own test file. Maybe it possible to test with screenshot tests, but how it runs now?\r\n\r\nP. S.

In this case, the defined width and height will be taken as the new width and height.

Can it be removed, adjusted higher or an additional option added to ignore it?\r\n\r\nWith the current 4096 max value limit in place it is impossible to use any proper \"out door\" unclipped HDRI images without having incorrect lighting.\r\n\r\nFor example an extremely bright outdoor HDRI here (https://polyhaven.com/a/rustig_koppie) has peak brightness of over 300.000 for pixels directly in the center of the sun.\r\n\r\nA Playground example shows how the current limit incorrectly produces extremely dim lighting: https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#6CJSXS#2\r\n\r\nWith 4096 limit in place:\r\n![bright-hdr-sh-with-limit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1881360/235967809-4f45bc7f-74d5-47c3-82ce-77c38bda668e.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes removing the limit, in which case the calculated spherical harmonics produces correctly bright lighting even for bright outdoor HDRIs:\r\n![bright-hdr-sh-no-limit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1881360/235968047-f42d609a-8712-4e99-b12a-8379b792f6a7.jpg)\r\n",

This made the RTT render on a quarter of the screen (instead of half of the screen, as expected in XR with two eyes).\nThis changes RTT rendering in Rigged cameras (which ATM is mainly WebXR). It is expected that tha parent's camera will be the full viewport to render both eyes (which is 100% viewport in case of XR).\n\nIt is a small breaking change, but is actually more a bug fix.",

                "description": "This pull request combines feature requests of two forum threads from last year:\r\n\r\n- https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/node-pbr-material-renders-black-if-mesh-doesnt-have-normals/29011\r\n- https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/default-nodematerial-vertex-color-input-to-white-if-attribute-doesnt-exist-on-mesh/29461\r\n\r\nI recently refactored a project where I used custom blocks to work around those issues above, and ended up with a single `MeshAttributeFallbackBlock` that I think might be flexible enough to be added to Babylon.js itself.\r\n\r\nThe nodeblock itself is pretty simple. It allows connecting to an attribute input (or morph target block) and has another falback input to provide value if mesh doesn't have the said attribute.\r\n\r\nHere is a test NME url (only works with these PR changes in place): `/#W3ZANW` and a Playground test url: `/#5LCPMS`\r\n\r\nThe above example demonstrates three use cases where such node is useful / necessary:\r\n\r\n### Vertex color fallback\r\n\r\nThis allows using same NodeMaterial with meshes or mesh primitives that contain and don't contain vertex colors. Currently if vertex color is used, it defaults to black color when attribute is present and there is no way to distinguish between actually intented black color and missing attribute.\r\n\r\n![Vertex Color Fallback](https://static.miikah.fi/other/images/nme_vertex_color_fallback.png)\r\n\r\n### Normal fallback\r\n\r\nIt is possible to generate flat normal in fragment shader if attribute isn't present. This matches gltf spec where a flat normal is used for meshes that don't contain normals.\r\n\r\n![Normal Fallback](https://static.miikah.fi/other/images/nme_normal_fallback.png)\r\n\r\n### UV fallback\r\n\r\nAnd kind of as additional possibility that my original normal and vertex color specific nodes didn't allow, is generating UV fallback with a generated UV if attribute isn't present.\r\n\r\n![UV Fallback](https://static.miikah.fi/other/images/nme_generated_uv_fallback.png)",

The user must now prefix all inputs/outputs with the correct object (`vertexInputs`/`vertexOutputs`/`fragmentInputs`/`fragmentOutputs`). This is a breaking change but it's the only way to make it work with WebGPU, and WebGPU isn't out yet so it doesn't matter much.\r\n* Updated caps based on actual limits retrieved from the device.\r\n* Uniformity analysis (UA) fixed. I did not disable uniformity analysis as a whole (`WebGPUTintWASM.DisableUniformityAnalysis = false`), let's see if we get any feedback from users because of the failure of uniformity analysis (all visual tests are successful).\r\n* there are still two visualization tests that fail (\"Shadows CSM and LODs\" and \"Multi shadow generators per light\") because of https://bugs.chromium.org/p/tint/issues/detail?id=1886\r\n* several fixes (wrong depth/stencil texture format in MultiRenderTarget in some cases, memory leaks, etc.)\r\n\r\nFixes #13633, #13564",

                "description": "A user in the forum found an issue where they were starting and stopping a pointerlock during a drag motion.  At the end of their movement, it was found that there was a strange rotation made in an unintended angle.  It was determined that `isPointerLock` wasn't being updated during the first move to occur after the lock was released.  The `pointerlockchange` event was being fired after the move was being handled so the camera input thought that a pointerlock was actinve and moved accordingly.  This PR will change the behavior of isPointerLock to check and update isPointerLock during a `pointermove` event when a pointerlock is active.\r\n\r\nForum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/camera-does-a-strange-rotation-on-cursor-lock/37904",

Upon closer inspection, it was determined that the WheelEvent was being given an erroneous pointerId, causing two different meshes under pointers to be stored.  This PR will fix the logic and remove the offending check from the InputManager to make it more platform-agnostic.\r\n\r\nFor Safari, all mouse pointerIds will be set to 1, if undefined.  This is because 1 is the current pointerId recognized when a pointercapture is active.  The pointercapture test for Safari has been updated to properly check this.\r\n\r\nForum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/triggering-pointer-out-actions-when-camera-change-causes-pointer-to-exit-mesh/39061",

                "description": "### Summary\r\nThis fix massively improves SSAO2 when using low sample counts, like the default 8.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nIt was discovered as part of PR #13621 but is submitted as a new PR since 13621 is now all about adding control over the SSAO2 denoiser without changing anything by default.\r\n\r\nThis small change however is so massively positive in all the tests I have done that it shouldn't be left out by default but be considered a bugfix.\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nThe fix is rather simple. When calculating if sample X is occluded by sample Y in the SSAO2 calculations we considered everything with a depth difference of 0 (zero) to mean Y occludes X. However, this does not take any calculation or precision errors into account, which causes samples along a \"flat\" surface to occlude each other. Basically, the flat surface was occluding itself...\r\n\r\nThis fix adds an epsilon of sorts to the calculation. The value 0.02 was selected from testing and gave the best improvements on all tests I did and at the same time practically left the 16-sample case untouched.\r\n\r\nThat said, on hardware that doesn't have the same precision in the shaders. might benefit from a higher threshold, as would some scenes like the kitchen example. But going over 0.02 starts to affect samples >=16 which isn't great from a backward compatibility standpoint.\r\n\r\nI did not make this into a tunable setting, since I don't expect that a user of Babylon.js would understand how it affects the shader calculations. This should just work.\r\n\r\n### Test results\r\nIn the screenshots below, the \"8x\" part denotes how many SSAO2 samples were used, old version is on the left and the new one is on the right.\r\n\r\nNotice how the fixed version is pretty similar to the 16x reference when the sample count goes down. But the old version goes bananas with incorrect occlusions everywhere. Also note that the two versions at sample count 16 are basically identical.\r\n\r\nThe images were saved without the blur-stage of the SSAO2 filter active, to better show the SSAO2 calculations.\r\n\r\n#### Terrain (#N96NXC#127)\r\n#### 16x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774831-d85b9050-f1a5-403f-b6e1-61c529454576.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774837-3371b66a-8158-41f7-9493-54516b75bfe0.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 12x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774821-04e478ad-0486-4ce0-88f3-146cc7ac9f03.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774826-deb8ec49-c573-4166-b68c-de79fd5faa61.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 8x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774799-e9c31bac-3701-42e3-b7ac-787d005ca85b.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774815-c77ae725-930e-4bb3-ac6e-3b1ea2669862.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n##### 4x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774770-2c835b0b-c975-49d6-a2f4-c72c59e6e2bf.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226774781-d8046245-0d5a-43e8-959a-b79192d560de.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### Cat (#T3K2SA#1)\r\n#### 16x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775114-4eab9d30-243c-445c-a9db-69cafb4517a0.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775121-f5b54df1-141d-4831-8009-1f3e2aee28bb.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 12x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775087-7ef5ae1e-e915-4390-812f-aa0a41782c78.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775098-6b8ffcfb-b956-467b-b155-aa106f895384.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 8x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775071-8d1056be-688b-4026-b31c-807259ae2464.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775079-5fd547b9-0daf-43b6-a522-d04ebef5e986.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 4x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775032-6614547a-cad3-4077-90f2-17bcbfc34af0.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775055-e2c308b5-40e6-4979-928d-92f59f63b055.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n\r\n### Room (#LCUPCU#14)\r\n#### 16x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775203-f00eba22-9625-43e4-8a00-cd200fb2290d.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775212-ecc1247d-c586-49a6-a7f7-d1ddf87eebe5.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 12x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775185-70b1209f-f7d3-48f6-af15-4c0c31c0a733.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775193-69fd1987-2ed4-41e2-9c62-6947fc1c2868.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 8x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775164-10d8d6fa-8717-470f-9196-cf6c6312735d.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775175-3cc2ca52-6de8-4ec2-b085-e93f8c9b4ab0.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n#### 4x\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775145-d4bee5a3-56e4-458d-b4f0-e8a5940f22ac.png\" width=50% height=50%><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984279/226775153-79bf0883-3a7b-4c54-bc70-9863eae0eaff.png\" width=50% height=50%>\r\n",

A class that let's you generate decals in a texture with `MeshUVSpaceRenderer.renderTexture(texture, position, normal, size, angle)`. The texture creation and the rendering of the decal is handled by the class.\r\n  * Assign a `MeshUVSpaceRenderer` instance to `mesh.decalMap` to enable the feature for the mesh\r\n* Material side:\r\n  * `DecalMapConfiguration`. A material plugin, implemented much like `DetailMapConfiguration` for the detail map feature.\r\n  * Enable the decal map rendering with `material.decalMap.isEnabled = true`.\r\n  * This class will automatically bind the texture from `mesh.decalMap`, which means a single material with decal map enabled can be used for multiple meshes, one does not have to create a material instance per mesh that needs to support decal map.\r\n\r\nTest PG: http://localhost:1338/#9BVW2S#48\r\n\r\nI will also update the docs.",

                "description": "This is done to avoid the pattern of adding an observer after checking if the state requires that.\nAs an example let's take the scene's onReadyObservable which has a simple state - it will only notify once when the scene is ready. If a new observer will be added after the observable was triggered (and has notified existing observers) it will not be possible to trigger new observers that were added to is.\nIf `notifyIfTriggered` is set to true and the observable has already triggered it will automatically trigger newly added observers whenever they are added.\n\nIt's also recommended to add that to onDispose observables, which are the same.\nA different solution would be to define an onObserverAdded function, but that would require setting this function to every observable that requires it. Instead - this is a more generic solution.",

The reason for this is that by default, the capabilities of e.g. Safari include ASTC, so the ASTC transcoder is selected even without the default options, e.g.:\r\n```js\r\n> console.log(gl.getExtension('WEBGL_compressed_texture_astc'))\r\n[Log] WebGLCompressedTextureASTC {getSupportedProfiles: function, COMPRESSED_RGBA_ASTC_4x4_KHR: 37808, COMPRESSED_RGBA_ASTC_5x4_KHR: 37809, COMPRESSED_RGBA_ASTC_5x5_KHR: 37810, COMPRESSED_RGBA_ASTC_6x5_KHR: 37811, …}\r\n```\r\nBut in Chrome, for example, this extension does not exist (that's weird, no?), so the caps of the engine do not have `astc` set:\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log(gl.getExtension('WEBGL_compressed_texture_astc'));\r\nnull\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis resolves my issue, but I'm not familiar with the inner workings of this subsystem and the potential other implications of these changes, so I would like to ask for comments & feedback. Thank you!",

                "description": "A user on the forums had recently found an issue when performing input while using an on-demand rendering loop.  The issue was that the `onViewMatrixChangedObservable` wasn't firing as a part of pointer input.  This behavior was present in previous versions.  It was determined that the Lazy Picking changes may have caused this change because the aforementioned observable only fires during `getViewMatrix()` calls.  Before the Lazy Picking implementation, this function was called as a part of the creation and assignment of the picking ray for a PickingInfo object.  Since this ray is only created when picking happens, a pointer event that doesn't require picking info won't ever get to the point where `getViewMatrix` is called.  Technically, these get functions should be called as a part of the camera's update function so the fix is to do just that.\r\n\r\nTests have been added to verify that `onViewMatrixObservable` and `onProjectionMatrixObservable` are firing properly.\r\n\r\nForum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/on-demand-rendering-solution-broken-since-5-29/36379/1\r\nIssue Link: https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/issues/13551",

                "description": "My last PR: #13513 introduced logic to refresh the VideoTexture's internal texture when the underlying video changed sizes.\r\n\r\nI missed an edge case where the resize event can occur on the same frame that the texture was already updated from. When that happens the new texture was not getting hooked up to the video feed because of a no-op condition that avoids updating the texture twice in one frame. This change ensures that when swapping out the internal texture it also gets re-registered with the video feed.",

                "description": "This PR updates VideoTexture to listen for the [VideoElement resize event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLVideoElement/videoHeight#examples) and resize the texture to match. For a URL video the scenario would not be common, but when creating a video from a camera stream you can use the media constraints to change the resolution/aspect ratio on the fly. Another camera example is when on mobile and you rotate the phone the video stream also resizes from portrait to landscape orientation.\r\n\r\nI created this Playground example to demonstrate the current issue (and to test my PR changes):\r\n[https://playground.babylonjs.com/#4W5WYX](https://playground.babylonjs.com/#4W5WYX)\r\n\r\nIn the playground app the camera's aspect ratio is updated ever 3 seconds to go between 16:9 and 1:1 aspect ratios. Without these changes the video just gets squashed when the aspect ratio changes, additionally if the end user tried to readPixels from the texture they would not get the full image due to a missmatch between the internal texture and the actual video frames.\r\n\r\nWith these changes the plane that the VideoTexture is placed on is able to respond to the change in aspect ratio so the video does not become distorted. Additionally readPixels is able to pull the full frame of the camera and match the native video resolution.\r\n\r\nThis issue is mentioned in the BabylonNative repo here:\r\n[https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/issues/1107](https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/issues/1107)\r\n",

If the sound stops on its own when reaching the end of the sound source, the start time and current time are not reset. This causes the `currentTime` property to report the wrong time when the sound is restarted after stopping on its own, and then being paused.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes the issue by resetting the start time and current time when the sound source ends on its own.\r\n\r\nReported on forum here: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/sound-currenttime-exceeds-total-duration-in-some-cases/37668",

The options defined in this way have priority over those passed when creating a KTX2 texture with `new Texture(...)`. This way you can easily force certain behaviors for the decoder without altering the way KTX2 textures are created.\r\n\r\nTo resolve the issue raised in the forum thread linked above, proceed as follows:\r\n```javascript\r\nBABYLON.KhronosTextureContainer2.DefaultKTX2DecoderOptions.useRGBAIfOnlyBC1BC3AvailableWhenUASTC = true;\r\n```\r\nwhich will force the use of uncompressed RGBA if only BC1 and BC3 are available as compressed formats.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] Note that `useRGBAIfOnlyBC1BC3AvailableWhenUASTC = true` is the default, for performance reason (see comments in code) [/EDIT]\r\n\r\nNote that `ktx2decoderTypes.ts` is defined in the core and not in the **ktx2Decoder** package to avoid an external dependency for the core and I'm not sure that `Materials/Textures/` is the best location for this file...",

This is confusing.

I just make some 2 files more consistent where we used to use a mix of both, and I updated the `ThinEngine.QueueNewFrame` to NOT call `window.setTimeout`, but to fall back on the global `setTimeout`.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo really be \"environment  independant\", we should never call a function that is \"environment  dependant\" directly, and put them all behind a configurable callback registry. This registry would be initialized with default values, and could be customizes by the user depending on its needs. But I'm not sure how it is doable, and anyway that's another story :)\r\n",

In order to achieve that, there're a few changes I need to make:\r\n\r\n1. Change the visibility of `_dragPlane` field from private to protected to allow more customization in the inherited class.\r\n2. Force calling `releaseDrag` if the start dragging failed to prevent the freezing (not be able to drag) due to how the dragging state is handled\r\n3. Pass the information of the active pointer in the drag observables in addition to the `pointerId`, this is to let the user have  access to more information about the pointer and it especially useful when detecting the type of the event (e.g. click, touch)",

                "description": "IMO, this added note in the installation documentation can clear possible confusion between using 'babylonjs' and using its '@babylonjs/core' counterpart.\r\n\r\nAn example for this possible confusion can be seen in [this](https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/difference-between-babylonjs-and-babylonjs-npm-packages/28380/4) forum question.\r\n\r\nI think the reason this can be confusing is that some NPM packages use a none-scoped package such as 'package-name' that uses a scoped package ('@scope/package-name') behind the scenes. With `Babylon.js`, this is not the case, you can use one or the other, the original package or its ES6 counterpart, not both.\r\n\r\nThis note clears this up. \r\n\r\nPerhaps even add a complete section to emphasis the ES6 version installation process? Will the ES6 version be the recommended go-to version in the near future?",

Then, it periodically executes the opposite operation, cloning the editor controllers and adding them to the live scene.  ",

Shared things are in `physics/`\r\n- v1 and v2 have different names (body/shape/material/constraint in V2 and impostor/joint in V1) and different concepts\r\n- Have an helper `PhysicsAggregate` that will contain a body, a material and a shape that can be created by 1 call (just like existing v1)\r\n\r\nOn the Babylon side, Material, shape, body are opaque proxies. Real work is done in the plugin. Plugin stores its references thanks to `public _pluginData: any = undefined;`\r\n\r\nPhysicsViewer, mesh,....still using v1.\r\n\r\nTested with PG from documentation and PhysicsDebug Viewer.\r\n",

However, it's not a small task and I'm not a React expert, so I have not done it as part of this PR.\r\n\r\nIf we don't want to reference the LiLGUI package from `FluidRenderingGUI`, maybe I should remove the class and add it in the documentation for users as a debugging tool?\r\n\r\nCloses #13087 ",

                "description": "A user on the forums recently found an issue related to `onPointerObservable` where skipNextObservers weren't working as they used to.  This issue was a side effect of an optimization make in support of Lazy Picking.  This optimization would take all internal camera inputs and remove them from the user-facing `onPointerObservable`.  This would cause the camera input observers to be inaccessible in the same way.  This PR will add them back to `onPointerObservable` but keep track of how many camera input observers have been added and require either user-defined observer as part of the criteria for picking.\r\n\r\nForum Post: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/no-longer-able-to-cancel-camera-inputs-with-new-oncamerainputobservable/35793",

In the PG demo below, we have implemented a very basic one with a `CustomBlock`.\r\n\r\nHere is a PG that uses all these new features:\r\n\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#M3QR7E#34\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4152247/203122324-d3f20b41-c7c5-40b9-96ab-b0baa03da9ca.png)\r\n",

Baking texture transform is not actually a valid solution when texture transform cannot fit the `KHR_texture_transform` extension.\r\n3. Exporting textures go through an unnecessary step of encoding from array buffer to base64 and then back. This is dumb.\r\n4. Code was a mess. Some weird async constructs and code duplication.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Log a warning instead of baking the texture when the texture transform isn't center at the origin.\r\n- Rewrite a chunk of the material export code to de-dupe textures based on whether the texture points to the same internal texture (and mime type).\r\n- Factor the code.",

The problem is that the cascaded shadow generator (CSG) generates the shadow map depending on a camera position/rotation. So, a CSG is only valid for a light + a camera: if rendering with another camera, the CSG for this light is invalid.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for multiple shadow generators per light: an additional `camera` parameter can be passed to the shadow generator constructor. By default, `camera=null` and the code is backward compatible: when you retrieve a shadow generator, you get the one for the null camera.\r\n\r\nFix #12716.\r\n\r\nHere's a fixed PG:\r\n\r\nhttps://playground.babylonjs.com/#11BH6Z#947",

I've run \"npm run test:unit\" and \"npm run build:dev\" in GitPod, both were OK. The one-line change fixed the bug in my local repro.\r\n\r\nDetails of the bug (copied from the forum post):\r\n\r\n1. Add two meshes to a scene, add both to the glow layer, set both to use their own material (referenceMeshToUseItsOwnMaterial).\r\n2. Make the meshes partially transparent.\r\n3. Move the camera so it is looking through transparent parts of one mesh to see the other.\r\n4. The far-away mesh will lose its glow effect when seen through the transparent parts of the close mesh.\r\n\r\nDemo: https://playground.babylonjs.com/#SRZRWV#1139\r\n(Move the camera so that you are looking at parts of one glowing ball through the transparent parts of another ball. Observe that the parts of the far-away ball seen through the close-up ball do not glow.)",

                "description": "Recently, there was a bug fix put out that addressed an issue where a POINTERTAP event was occurring if the cursor happened to return to the same position after moving outside of the tap range.  Unfortunately, there was a missed scenario where the swipe state wasn't being properly reset if we skipped the next observable call (like when clicking on a UI element).  This PR adds a check to make sure that we reset the swipe state if we are skipping said call.  \r\n\r\nRelated Forum Post: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/first-pointerpick-event-is-not-emitted-immediately-after-interacting-with-gui-control-that-is-a-pointerblocker/35008",

I ended up refactoring/simplifying most of the KHR_animation_pointer code, but the overall idea is still the same.\r\n\r\n- Fix the code such that it will call animation loading extension functions again. This is the main thing that was broken.\r\n- Update the contract for loading animations to support custom extensions to be more flexible without override arguments (e.g., `animationTargetOverride`).\r\n- Break up the animation pointer map into core and extensions to avoid core loader depending on code from an extension.\r\n- Greatly simplify parsing of animation pointers.",

The property of PointsCloudSystem `mesh` has incorrect type. In fact this property may have `undefined` as value, because it's not defined in the constructor. So I add optional mark `?` to type and required checks in the class.\r\n2. And after this I found what the `intersectsMesh` function did not check the mesh property existing in the point cloud system. So I add a new Error here, that notice about required mesh to next calculations.\r\n3. The line `isSphere = isSphere ? isSphere : false;` look like redundant, because TypeScript promise that it have boolean type.\r\n4. Next I move the getBoundingInfo call into one line `const bbox = target.getBoundingInfo().boundingBox;`. It's look for me as potential performance boost, maybe.\r\n5. And at the end I remove `else` branch because it rendundant because the code above have return statements.\r\n\r\nAnd I limited test cases from 729 possible combinations to 126, they seems like corner cases for me. I dont know which cases we can reduce to save the working guarantee.",

                "description": "I ran into a situation where I wanted to use the sound engine in Babylon to play my pre-generated Web Audio Buffer. I managed to get it to work by looking at the code, but I had to access some private properties. I noticed that it would be pretty small refactoring to implement it correctly since the code was already there. This PR enable the passing of an AudioBuffer to the constructor of BABYLON.Sound.\r\n\r\nThis (very simplified) example shows how it is used:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar createScene = function () {\r\n\r\n    var scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine);\r\n    const camera = new BABYLON.ArcRotateCamera(\"Camera\", -Math.PI / 2, Math.PI / 4, 15, BABYLON.Vector3.Zero());\r\n    camera.attachControl(canvas, true);\r\n\r\n    // Create buffer\r\n    let sineBuffer = BABYLON.Engine.audioEngine.audioContext.createBuffer(1, 12e3, 48e3);\r\n    const hitBufferData = sineBuffer.getChannelData(0);\r\n    for (let i = 12e3; i--;) hitBufferData[i] = Math.cos(i * .04); \r\n\r\n    // Create and use the sound\r\n    this.sineSound = new BABYLON.Sound(\"sine\", sineBuffer); \r\n    this.sineSound.play();\r\n\r\n    return scene;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

During apointer move, the cached integer was not updated, so onPointerMove you wouldn't be able to check the depth to the button. onPointerDown's depth is correct, as onPointerDown is triggered when the button is defined as pressed, which is not when the sphere's center is at the end of the button, but a little before. This \"little\" before is defined by the pickRadius in near interaction (0.02 units).\n\nThis PR updated the height variable on pointer move as well, which would allow to check the distance correctly when using pointer move.",

                "description": "My apologies for the length of this comment, it is because I need advice on whether it will be part of my very limited project or a much larger undertaking by the community. As a large community undertaking it needs considering and approval by @deltakosh along with @PirateJC and @RaananW as it involves the docs even though it is on the API side and I would like to include @sebavan as he as also been very supportive and helpful to me. Please include anyone else you would like to talk to about it.\r\n\r\n**Reason Behind PR**\r\nWithin the API classes the search the playground for each property and method is at best hit and miss, so I thought that each property and method of a class should have its own playground example, which should be simple and as meaningful as possible. For my limited project, except for a few where they were trivial or I couldn't think of a good example or I forgot, I have done this for all the methods and classes of Vector3 in this PR.\r\n\r\n**Implications for a Large Community Undertaking**\r\nAn announcement about the undertaking.\r\nIf members do put in example PGs they could come in piecemeal so lots of individual PRs, unless there was somewhere else to submit them. This would require a moderator or moderators.\r\nSome rules for submitting an example PG, eg\r\n1. PGs should be simple and where possible meaningful.\r\n2. Code for the particular property or method should appear near the top of the PG\r\n        When meaningful means more complex code this can be achieved by wrapping the\r\n        a. method code in a function as in [https://playground.babylonjs.com/#R1F8YU#111](https://playground.babylonjs.com/#R1F8YU#111)\r\n         b. method code within an onBeforeRenderObservable as in [https://playground.babylonjs.com/#R1F8YU#63](https://playground.babylonjs.com/#R1F8YU#63)\r\n         c. complex code within functions as in [https://playground.babylonjs.com/#R1F8YU#106](https://playground.babylonjs.com/#R1F8YU#106)\r\n3. There should be comments at the top describing the method/property also stating the example use matching a template\r\n4. Template PGs for each class would be needed\r\n5. New or edited methods without a PG should have a PG submitted when method PR submitted\r\n\r\nI am sure there are more implications and I am happy for the rules to change. I only came up with them after doing half the methods.\r\n\r\nAlso as members of the community have their own agendas it is probably wishful thinking that enough people would get involved to get it done.\r\n\r\nIn terms of my very limited project I am happy to continue with the math.vector.ts classes, eg Vector2, Vector4, etc\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think and whether it is just my limited project or a community appeal.",

                "description": "Hello.\r\n\r\nI have been working on updating our electron app to the latest electron version (20.0.1, previously we used 17.3.1) and we had a breakage in our use of babylon.js when the scene is disposed:\r\n\r\n> TypeError: Failed to execute 'unobserve' on 'ComputePressureObserver': 1 argument required, but only 0 present.\r\n\r\nNote that not all electron applications will experience this problem. ComputePressureObserver is only exposed if you use `experimentalFeatures: true`.\r\n\r\nIt appears that electron 19 and up is using a Chromium version with an updated ComputePressureObserver API. Here is the relevant change in [the working draft](https://wicg.github.io/compute-pressure/):\r\n- https://github.com/WICG/compute-pressure/issues/21\r\n- https://github.com/WICG/compute-pressure/pull/25\r\n\r\nThe error is ignored in `observe` but not in `unobserve`. My first commit here catches the error in `unobserve`. I first tried to use `catch()` like in `observe` but it didn't work so I had to use `try { ... } catch {}`. Even though it isn't documented in the spec, `observe` is returning a promise but `unobserve` is not.\r\n\r\nThe second commit updates the use of the observer to work with electron >= 19. This disables the observer for electron < 19 (`ComputePressureObserver.supportedSources` is not defined), but I don't think many will notice since the only thing this is used for is the CPU utilization metric in the Realtime Performance Viewer.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-08-09 at 14 41 31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991151/183777526-040bc374-458b-446a-9fd6-5f26676ef13b.png)\r\n\r\nThe spec appears to have more updates than what electron supports. Doesn't look like the `samplerate` property works.\r\n\r\nI made this simple Electron Fiddle that can be used to test with: https://gist.github.com/stefansundin/4cee8e88133efb196f54f2d2a9f05155. You need to run `npm run start` to run the babylon.js server as well.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you want me to change anything! Thanks!",

It annoyed me that the `step` of the position fields was a bit low (pressing the up/down arrow keys only moved it slightly).\r\n\r\nThis PR solves that issue by using modifier keys. You can now hold `shift` to increase the step x10. Additionally, if you hold `ctrl` (`meta` on mac) as well, it will increase x100.\r\n\r\nI implemented this feature for both the `NumericInputComponent` and `FloatLineComponent` so it should work for all number input fields in the inspector.",

If I change from `private` to `protected`, eslint complains about naming convention, but I wonder whether it is worth to rename.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nprivate static _RotationGizmoFragmentShader\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll leave this as a draft for discussion for now, and meanwhile continue to test the extendability on this PR.\r\n ",

This has been tested with success with all the samples provided as part of the Khronos proposal.\r\nEven if functional, the code is still not very clean and many ehancement must be done in order to reach a certain level of quality. However, calendar issue drive us to put this onto PR rapidely.\r\n[AnimateAllTheThings.zip](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/files/9144599/AnimateAllTheThings.zip)\r\nThis can be tested with the file above, which encompass all the cases supported by the `KHR_animation_pointer`.\r\nThe main changes are located into 3 files.\r\n`GLTFLoader` has been simplified by moving all the animation related code to the `KHR_animation_pointer.ts` where the extension lies. `KHR_animation_pointer.map.ts` contains the pointer tree mapping and miscellaneous function to serve the pointer parsing and logic.\r\nAll the other change are to support indirection between GLTF entities and Babylon ones. This is subject to discussion, because not very \"clean\".\r\nMay close #12544 \r\n",

Press left button, middle button, then right button (Do not let go of any of them)\r\n3. Release them in this order while moving around a bit (Right, Left, Middle)\r\n4. Now camera movement should be locked to your cursor movement\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the DeviceSourceManager/DeviceInputSystem is still storing the correct values.  This fix removes the check from the InputManager.",

                "description": "Illustration showing left and right eyes in a HoloLens 2 running BabylonNative:\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"stereo-clear-artifacts\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4724014/180064594-238f7fc0-6b3f-4aeb-bd45-9c7e5244362b.png\">\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/issues/1087\r\n\r\nThere were two issues going on here. The first is that we needed to render the utility layer _after_ rendering to both eyes in the target scene. By rendering the utility layer scene in between eye renders, we were getting weird clearing behavior that is hard to describe. The second is that we were double-clearing our output render target textures in cases where `RenderTargetTexture.skipInitialClear = false`.\r\n\r\nBy changing the observable used in `utilityLayerRenderer` from `onAfterCameraRenderObservable` to `onAfterRenderCameraObservable`, we're making sure to render the layer only once after finishing both eyes (instead of after the left and before the right and then again after both eyes). This doesn't meaningfully change any behavior in rendering scenarios with cameras without sub-cameras.\r\n\r\nBy checking `Scene.autoClear` when clearing the camera's output render target, we avoid clearing our render targets when rendering multiple scenes that are supposed to layer onto those render targets. This means that clearing behavior when rendering a scene to a render target matches the clearing behavior when rendering that same scene to the default frame buffer. **This is a breaking change for experiences that expected the scene not to honor `autoClear = false` when rendering to a RTT, but this is not documented/expected behavior as far as I know.**\r\n\r\nWe weren't seeing this bug in any other scenario (i.e. Oculus on Web, native iOS, native Android, etc) because on all other platforms `RenderTargetTexture.skipInitialClear = true`, and so we never saw any weird clearing behavior because the RTT's were never getting cleared in the first place, which on those platforms is totally acceptable because they get automatically cleared by either the WebXR runtime or the BabylonNative XR implementation at the top of the frame.\r\n\r\n",

Somehow this WebAPI is defined in regular Babylon Native (there is no native polyfill, so is JSC/V8 providing this?), though it is unnecessary (the `src` property is unused in Babylon Native's `VideoTexture` implementation), and in React Native `window.URL.createObjectURL` is polyfilled partially and dies on this call. Avoiding this call makes `VideoTexture` work in Babylon React Native. The extra direct check for `video.isNative` in the BJS code is not great, but other code in this file already does it, so following the existing pattern.",

This had worked previously in 4.2.  Upon further investigation, it was found that the code used in the InputManager to route the input calls had omitted these buttons.  This PR will add them back into the InputManager.\r\n\r\nForum Post: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/scene-onpointerobservable-doesnt-catch-mouse4-and-mouse5-events-in-babylonjs-5/32225",

My original fixes addressed the original logic, which was incorrectly assigning the passive property, and makes the default value true.  This also includes removal of the preventDefault code from some of our cameras.\r\n\r\nThis current PR will accomplish two things.  One, it will revert the changes from 12703.  Second, it will set the default state of the passive property to false.  This should address an issue found in the forums where the original behavior would successfully allow for preventDefault but the newest one wouldn't.\r\n\r\nForum link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/camera-zoom-scrolling-the-page-introduced-in-5-13-1/32223/6",

The conversion constants and formulas are described in the Wikipedia article for sRGB: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB\r\n\r\nI opted to make this option a property passed into the engine, as it feels somewhat similar functionally to the engine option for high precision floats i.e., it affects many things (in this case, many shaders). IMO it would be odd to use the approximation in one shader and the exact formula in another. I think most of the time, you'd either want it always or never.",

                "description": "Stemming from this [prev PR](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/12643) prepareDefines is now called after PrepareDefinesForAttributes so that the plugin's defines aren't overwritten. However some of the built-in plugins rely on prepareDefines being called before PrepareDefinesForAttributes (in particular the ones that call PrepareDefinesForMergedUV which needs to be called before PrepareDefinesForAttributes).\r\n\r\nSo this PR just changes these plugins to use prepareDefinesBeforeAttributes, which is called before PrepareDefinesForAttributes to match the original behavior (this is the same fix that was created for the PBRAnisotropicConfiguration plugin in the original PR, which I thought was the only one affected).\r\n\r\nForum issue about the PBRSheenConfiguration plugin: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/texture-not-displaying-for-sheen-extension/32110",

Additionally, there are tests to verify that our skip booleans (eg. skipPointerUpPredicate) will prevent picking in scenarios where we don't want to pick.  As part of this process, we also can verify that the DeviceInputSystem/DeviceSourceManager can talk to the InputManager to propagate pointer events up.\r\n\r\nGUI Input Test: https://playground.babylonjs.com/#UB4F3B#7\r\nThis test validates that GUI elements such as TextBlocks, InputTexts, and Buttons are usable with Keyboard and Mouse input.  Furthermore, this will verify that the 6 observables will work with our buttons (move, up, down, out, enter, click).  While the first test verifies that the DIS/DSM can talk with the InputManager, this one will show that the InputManager can also talk with GUI elements.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that all simulated input is done with Pointer/KeyboardEvent objects and the `dispatchEvent` function.  Some modifications will be needed if these tests are to run on Babylon Native.",

This has led to a scenario where said buttons weren't being properly treated as released.  Upon investigation, it has been determined that this issue occurs at an OS level and therefore, there isn't much we can do about it (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11818637/why-does-javascript-drop-keyup-events-when-the-metakey-is-pressed-on-mac-browser).  This PR contains a workaround so that if BJS is being run in a browser on MacOS, any buttons pressed while the Meta key is active will be tracked and have `keyup` events fired for them when the Meta key is released.  All other platforms will work as before without this tracking code.\r\n\r\nForum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/modifier-keyboard-shortcuts-with-devicesourcemanager-copy-to-clipboard/31743/7",

After investigating the issue, it was found that the mouse events were triggering both mouse and touch movement.  The main issue was that, in FreeCameraTouchInput, the `isMouseEvent` boolean was incorrect being evaluated as false for mouse because the assigning logic was looking for a parameter that isn't available to mouse events generated in Safari.  The fix was to modify the logic to work with Safari-specific mouse events.\r\n\r\nRelevant Forum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/keyboard-control-not-working-for-latest-universalcamera-in-desktop-safari/31314/8",

After some investigation, it was found that the `touchMoveSensibility` property was being used in a denominator inside of the `checkInputs` function.  Because of this, if `touchMoveSensibility` was zero, it'd create a divide by zero scenario that would effectively render the camera's `cameraDirection` vector to be a vector of NaNs.  The fix for this was to just add a check to see if `touchMoveSensibility` was zero and handle things accordingly.\r\n\r\nForum link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/keyboard-control-not-working-for-latest-universalcamera-in-desktop-safari/31314",

When a dummy predicate was used (`() => false`), there was still a pickedmesh/point in the pickInfo object.  This PR does a couple of things:\r\n- Fix for the picking logic to use the `pointerUpPredicate` and actually call `scene.pick`\r\n- Add a boolean to scene that allows the user to skip picking on pointerup (same as move and down)",

Params: name, size, scene\r\n  const box = MeshBuilder.CreateBox(\"box\", { size: 2 }, scene);\r\n\r\n  new FollowCamera(\"ArcRotateCamera\", new Vector3(2, 0, 0), scene, box);\r\n  const light = new HemisphericLight(\"light1\", new Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);\r\n\r\n  // Default intensity is 1. Let's dim the light a small amount\r\n  light.intensity = 0.7;\r\n\r\n  scene.registerBeforeRender(() => {\r\n    if (this.updatePan) {\r\n      (scene.activeCamera as any).alpha -= this._translateX / 6000;\r\n      (scene.activeCamera as any).beta -= this._translateY / 6000;\r\n    }\r\n    if (this.updatePinch) {\r\n      (scene.activeCamera as any).radius -= this._scale * 60;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    gl.endFrameEXP();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  engine.runRenderLoop(() => {\r\n    if (scene) {\r\n      scene.render();\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Cause\r\n\r\nWhat happens here is that at some point, the `Effect` class (packages/dev/core/src/Materials/effect.ts) will try to access the host document by only checking if `IsWindowObjectExist` returns true:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst hostDocument = IsWindowObjectExist() ? this._engine.getHostDocument() : null;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is, in this react-native context `window` will exist but not `document`, leading to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\n\r\nTo fix this,  I added a check in `getHostDocument` to make sure that `document` actually exist before returning it. If it doesn't, I simply return `null`.\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR in this repo, please let me know if I forgot anything.",

Upon closer inspection, it was determined that the logic that was used to detect if the input was from a mouse or not was incorrect.  It originally said that if the browser was a not from mobile browser and if the event was an instance of MouseEvent, that it was from the mouse.  The new logic just checks the pointer type and uses that, which is a much more reliable method and also works with touch devices using non-mobile browsers.\r\n\r\nForum Link: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/guys-i-got-a-problem-with-on-some-android-pad-cant-use-universalcamera-to-move-on-touch/30448/3",

The appropriate way of handling this type of problem would be to check bgfx capabilities and handle it appropriately on the JS side by setting ```canUseTextureForTargets``` property at ```MorphTargetManager```. This PR exposes all capabilities info provided by the Native Engine so they can be accessed by the js NativeEngine and appropriately handled by Babylon.js \r\n\r\n## Aditions\r\n\r\n- Exposed Native engine caps to javascript. \r\n- After this PR gets merged the following [Babylon Native PR](https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/pull/1075) can be merged.\r\n- Fixes [Android Morph Targets](https://github.com/BabylonJS/BabylonNative/issues/1049) issue on Babylon Native.

This reason for this fix was because a user had identified an issue where the pointerlock was successfully being set but keyboard input wasn't working.  This was due to the fact that requestPointerlock does not set focus when setting the pointerlock element so no keyboard input was being routed to the canvas.  This fix simply sets focus once the pointerlock element has been set.\r\n\r\nThis fix is in reference to this Forum post: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/input-not-recognised-until-window-resize-triggered-or-change-focus/15653",

So, in this case:\r\n```\r\nvar compoundBody = new BABYLON.Mesh(\"compoundBody\", scene);\r\ncompoundBody.position.y=3;\r\n\r\ncompoundBody.computeWorldMatrix(true);\r\nconsole.log(compoundBody.getBoundingInfo().boundingSphere.centerWorld.y);\r\nconsole.log(compoundBody.position.y);\r\n```\r\nmin and max are (0,3,0), bouding sphere local center is (0,3,0).\r\nworld bounding sphere center is local center transformed by world matrix and its value is (0,6, 0) which is not correct. It breaks the physics for oimo and cannon. Computation is different with ammo and was not touched by this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n@RaananW Git blame indicates you changed it last.
