## npm

BabylonJS and its modules are published on npm with full typing support. To install, use:

```text
npm install babylonjs --save
```

This will allow you to import BabylonJS entirely using:

```javascript
import * as BABYLON from 'babylonjs';
```

or individual classes using:

```javascript
import { Scene, Engine } from 'babylonjs';
```

If using TypeScript, don't forget to add 'babylonjs' to 'types' in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
    ...
    "types": [
        "babylonjs",
        "anotherAwesomeDependency"
    ],
    ...
```

To add a module, install the respective package. A list of extra packages and their installation instructions can be found on the [babylonjs user on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~babylonjs).

## Usage

See [Getting Started](https://doc.babylonjs.com/#getting-started):

```javascript
// Get the canvas DOM element
var canvas = document.getElementById('renderCanvas');
// Load the 3D engine
var engine = new BABYLON.Engine(canvas, true, {preserveDrawingBuffer: true, stencil: true});
// CreateScene function that creates and return the scene
var createScene = function(){
    // Create a basic BJS Scene object
    var scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine);
    // Create a FreeCamera, and set its position to {x: 0, y: 5, z: -10}
    var camera = new BABYLON.FreeCamera('camera1', new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 5, -10), scene);
    // Target the camera to scene origin
    camera.setTarget(BABYLON.Vector3.Zero());
    // Attach the camera to the canvas
    camera.attachControl(canvas, false);
    // Create a basic light, aiming 0, 1, 0 - meaning, to the sky
    var light = new BABYLON.HemisphericLight('light1', new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);
    // Create a built-in "sphere" shape; its constructor takes 6 params: name, segment, diameter, scene, updatable, sideOrientation
    var sphere = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateSphere('sphere1', 16, 2, scene, false, BABYLON.Mesh.FRONTSIDE);
    // Move the sphere upward 1/2 of its height
    sphere.position.y = 1;
    // Create a built-in "ground" shape; its constructor takes 6 params : name, width, height, subdivision, scene, updatable
    var ground = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateGround('ground1', 6, 6, 2, scene, false);
    // Return the created scene
    return scene;
}
// call the createScene function
var scene = createScene();
// run the render loop
engine.runRenderLoop(function(){
    scene.render();
});
// the canvas/window resize event handler
window.addEventListener('resize', function(){
    engine.resize();
});
```
