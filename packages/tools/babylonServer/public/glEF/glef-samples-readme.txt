Expected results:

twocubes: two blue cubes should appear next to each other. On scene start, one (not both) should spin

cubeandsphere: a blue cube and a green sphere should appear next to each other. On scene start, the cube should spin

loadbynode: a row of primary colored spheres, a yellow sphere, and a row of secondary colored spheres should appear offset vertically above each other. The row of secondary colors should be offset on z from the row of primaries. The yellow sphere should be aligned with the row of primaries.

loadbyscene: a row of primary colored spheres, a yellow sphere, and a row of secondary colored spheres should appear vertically above each other and centered on the x and z axes
