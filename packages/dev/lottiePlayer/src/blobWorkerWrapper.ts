/**
 * This class wraps a regular URL worker into a blob.
 * It is a common scenario to have the website served from one domain, and scripts from another one.
 * This can cause CSP issues if worker-src does not include the domain that serves the scripts. By
 * wrapping the worker into a blob, the only CSP required for worker-src is blob and the worker will
 * load correctly. script-src must still include the domain that serves the worker script and dependencies.
