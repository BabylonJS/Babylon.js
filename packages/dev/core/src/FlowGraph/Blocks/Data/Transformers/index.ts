/* 

This directory holds type conversions and type transformation blocks:

- Animation to Animation Group
- primitives to primitives (i.e. number/integer,boolean to each other)
- Animation time to animation frame (needed for glTF animations)
- glTF animation index to animationGroup index

Still TODO!
