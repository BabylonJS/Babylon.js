### Core Engine

- Added `animatable.onAnimationLoopObservable` ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Added `animationGroup.onAnimationLoopObservable` ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Added FlyCamera for free navigation in 3D space, with a limited set of settings ([Phuein](https://github.com/phuein))
- Added support for Scissor testing ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Added `Engine.onNewSceneAddedObservable` ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Added new `PassCubePostProcess` to render cube map content ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Added support for utility layer for SkeletonViewer ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Improved shader precision detection ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Added support for bone matrix texture. Now skeletons will use a texture instead of uniforms when possible ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Refactored of the SolidParticleSystem code for performance and code quality improvement ([barroij](https://github.com/barroij))
- Added utility function `Tools.BuildArray` for array initialisation ([barroij](https://github.com/barroij))
- Introduced a new `IOfflineSupport` interface to hide IndexedDB ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- `PBRMaterial` and `StandardMaterial` now use hot swapping feature for shaders. This means they can keep using a previous shader while a new one is being compiled ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Performance oriented changes ([barroij](https://github.com/barroij))
  - Prevented avoidable matrix inversion or square root computation
  - Enabled a removal in O(1) from the `transformNodes` array and `materials` array of the `Scene`. As a consequence, the order of the element within these arrays might change during a removal
  - Enabled a removal in O(1) from the `instances` array of a `Mesh`. As a consequence, the order of the element within this array might change during a removal
  - Stopped calling `Array.splice` on the `scene.meshes` array and on the `engine._uniformBuffer` when removing an element. As a consequence, the order of the element within these arrays might change during a removal
  - Added an option `useGeometryUniqueIdsMap` in the `Scene` constructor options. When set to true, each `Scene` isntance will have and will keep up-to-date a map of geometry per `uniqueId`. This is to avoid browsing all the geometries of the scene when a new one is being pushed. It also enables a removal of geometry in O(1). Disabled by default
  - Added an option `useMaterialMeshMap` in the `Scene` constructor options. When set to true, each `Material` isntance will have and will keep up-to-date a map of its bound meshes. This is to avoid browsing all the meshes of the scene to retrieve the ones bound to the current material when disposing the Material. Disabled by default
  - Added an option `useClonedMeshhMap` in the `Scene` constructor options. When set to true, each `Mesh` will have and will keep up-to-date a map of cloned meshes. This is to avoid browsing all the meshes of the scene to retrieve the ones that have the current mesh as source mesh. Disabled by default
  - Added `blockfreeActiveMeshesAndRenderingGroups` property in the `Scene`, following the same model as `blockMaterialDirtyMechanism`. This is to avoid calling `Scene.freeActiveMeshes` and `Scene.freeRenderingGroups` for each disposed mesh when we dispose several meshes in a row. One have to set `blockfreeActiveMeshesAndRenderingGroups` to `true` just before disposing the meshes, and set it back to `false` just after
  - Prevented code from doing useless and possible time consuming computation when disposing the `ShaderMaterial` of a `LinesMesh`
  - Make a better use of the `isIdentity` cached value wihtin a `Matrix`
  - Make sure we browse all the submeshes only once in `Material.markAsDirty` function
  - Added an `Vector3.UnprojectRayToRef` static function to avoid computing and inverting the projection matrix twice when updating a Ray.
- Align `BoundingBox` and `BoundingSphere` API and behavior for clarity and simplicity. As a consequence, the `BoundingBox`'s method `setWorldMatrix` has been removed and the underlying world matrix cannot be modified but by calling `reConstruct` or `update`. ([barroij](https://github.com/barroij))
- Make sure that `Material.markAsDirty` and all the `markXXXDirty` methods early out when `scene.blockMaterialDirtyMechanism` is true. ([barroij](https://github.com/barroij))
- Add updateUpVectorFromRotation to target camera to allow the up vector to be computed from rotation ([TrevorDev](https://github.com/TrevorDev))
- Added opacity texture support to `GridMaterial` ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Added support for deserializing morph target animations in animation groups
- AssetContainer dispose method ([TrevorDev](https://github.com/TrevorDev))
- Loading texture with KTX will fallback to non-KTX loader if KTX loader fails ([TrevorDev](https://github.com/TrevorDev))
- `Layer` are now supported in `RenderTargetTexture` ([Sebavan](https://github.com/Sebavan))
- Make onscreen joystick's canvas public ([TrevorDev](https://github.com/TrevorDev))
- Added `Tools.CustomRequestHeaders`, `Tools.UseCustomRequestHeaders`, `Tools.InjectCustomRequestHeaders` to send Custom Request Headers alongside XMLHttpRequest's i.e. when loading files (Tools.Loadfile) from resources requiring special headers like 'Authorization' ([susares](https://github.com/susares))
- Added `.serialize` and `.Parse` functions in `ReflectionProbe` to retrieve reflection probes when parsing a previously serialized material ([julien-moreau](https://github.com/julien-moreau))
- GizmoManager clearGizmoOnEmptyPointerEvent options and onAttachedToMeshObservable event ([TrevorDev](https://github.com/TrevorDev))
- Added support for overriding the mesh used for the world matrix for a mesh with a skeleton ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
- Added support for linking a bone to a transform node ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
- Factored out `setDirection` function from `lookAt` for transform node ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
- Add support for setting renderingGroupId and creating instances to `AxesViewer` ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
- Invert vScale of compressed ktx textures as they are inverted in the file and UNPACK_FLIP_Y_WEBGL is not supported by ktx ([TrevorDev](https://github.com/TrevorDev))
- Enable dragging in boundingBoxGizmo without needing a parent ([TrevorDev](https://github.com/TrevorDev))
- Added per mesh culling strategy ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))

### glTF Loader

- Added support for mesh instancing for improved performance when multiple nodes point to the same mesh ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
- Create `TransformNode` objects instead of `Mesh` objects for glTF nodes without geometry ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
- Added glTF JSON pointers to metadata of nodes, materials, and textures ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
- Load KTX textures in the gltf2 loader when textureFormat is set on engine ([TrevorDev](https://github.com/TrevorDev))
- Skinned meshes now behave as intended by glTF ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
  - Skinned meshes now set an override mesh instead of reparenting to the `__root__` transform node
  - Loaded bones are linked with the transform node created for the corresponding glTF node
