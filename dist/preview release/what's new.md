## Breaking changes

- [List of breaking changes introduced by our compatibility with WebGPU](https://doc.babylonjs.com/advanced_topics/webGPU/webGPUBreakingChanges)
  - [ReadPixels and ProceduralTexture.getContent are now async](https://doc.babylonjs.com/advanced_topics/webGPU/webGPUBreakingChanges#readpixels-is-now-asynchronous)
  - [Shader support differences](https://doc.babylonjs.com/advanced_topics/webGPU/webGPUBreakingChanges#shader-code-differences)
- Use both `mesh.visibility` and `material.alpha` values to compute the global alpha value used by the soft transparent shadow rendering code. Formerly was only using `mesh.visibility` ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- Depth renderer: don't render mesh if `infiniteDistance = true` or if `material.disableDepthWrite = true` ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- `Mesh.createInstance` no longer make a unique `Geometry` for the Mesh so updating one `Geometry` can affect more meshes than before. Use `Mesh.makeUniqueGeometry` for old behaviour. ([breakin](https://github.com/breakin))
- Ammo.js needs to be initialized before creating the plugin with `await Ammo();` since Ammo introduced an async init in their library. ([sebavan](https://github.com/sebavan))
- Recast.js needs to be initialized before creating the plugin with `await Recast();` since Recast introduced an async init in their library. ([CedricGuillemet](https://github.com/CedricGuillemet))
- Fixed spelling of `EventState.initialize` ([seritools](https://github.com/seritools))
- `SkeletonViewer` is now enabled by default ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- `BindEyePosition` has been moved from `Material` to `Scene` to avoid a circular dependency problem and is now a non-static method (`bindEyePosition`) ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- The depth renderer was not generating correct values for orthographic cameras when **storeNonLinearDepth = false** ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- `dataBuffer.ts` and `buffer.ts` have been moved from `Meshes/` to `Buffers/` ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- By default, the glTF loader now uses sRGB buffers for gamma encoded textures (when supported by the GPU), which is more accurate than using regular buffers. However, it can lead to small visual differences. You can disable usage of sRGB buffers by setting `glTFFileLoader.useSRGBBuffers` to `false` ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- 4th (`isAnimationSheetEnabled`) and 5th (`customEffect`) parameters of `GPUParticleSystem` constructor have been inverted to match `ParticleSystem` constructor ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- `PBRSubSurfaceConfiguration.useGltfStyleThicknessTexture` has been renamed to `PBRSubSurfaceConfiguration.useGltfStyleTextures` ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- Properties in `IWebXRHandTrackingOptions` related to hand and joint meshes have been moved into `jointMeshes` and `handMeshes` members, respectively ([rgerd](https://github.com/rgerd))
- `IWebXRHandTrackingOptions.jointMeshes.onHandJointMeshGenerated()` provides a `hand` instead of a `controllerId` in the parameters, since the tracked joint meshes are pre-generated ([rgerd](https://github.com/rgerd))
- You should now access joint meshes from `WebXRHand` through the `getJointMesh()` function ([rgerd](https://github.com/rgerd))
