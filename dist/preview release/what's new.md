# 3.2.0

## Major updates
- Improved building process: We now run a full visual validation test for each pull request. Furthermore, code comments and what's new updates are now mandatory ([sebavan](https://github.com/sebavan))
- Introduced texture binding atlas. This optimization allows the engine to reuse texture bindings instead of rebinding textures when they are not on constant sampler indexes ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- New [AnimationGroup class](http://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/group) to control simultaneously multiple animations with different targets ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- `WebVRCamera` now supports GearVR ([brianzinn](https://github.com/brianzinn))
- New glTF [serializer](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/tree/master/serializers/src/glTF/2.0). You can now export glTF or glb files directly from a Babylon scene ([kcoley](https://github.com/kcoley))
- Babylon.js now uses Promises in addition to callbacks. We created several `xxxAsync` functions all over the framework (`SceneLoader.AppendAsync` for instance, which returns a Promise). A polyfill is also integrated to support older browsers ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Introduced Projection Texture on SpotLight (`spotLight.projectedLightTexture`) ([lostink](https://github.com/lostink))

## Updates
- Tons of functions and classes received the code comments they deserved (All the community)
- Added support for all RGBA orders (BGR, RGB, etc..) for the DDS loader ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Improved [SceneOptimizer](http://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/how_to_use_sceneoptimizer) to provide better adaptability ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Improved `scene.isReady()` function which now takes in account shadows and LOD ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- New watcher configuration for VSCode. Now the task only compiles changed files ([sebavan](https://github.com/sebavan))
- Added new draw modes to engine (points, lines, linesloop, linestrip, trianglestrip, trianglefan) ([benaadams](https://github.com/benaadams))
- Added GUI Textblock.lineSpacing setter and getter to configure vertical space between lines in pixels or percentage values when working with text wrapping ([carloslanderas](https://github.com/carloslanderas))
- VRHelper now has onSelectedMeshUnselected observable that will notify observers when the current selected mesh gets unselected
  ([carloslanderas](https://github.com/carloslanderas))
- VRHelper now has onBeforeCameraTeleport and onAfterCameraTeleport observables that will be notified before and after camera teleportation is triggered.
  ([carloslanderas](https://github.com/carloslanderas))
- VRHelper now has the public property teleportationEnabled to enable / disable camera teleportation. 
   ([carloslanderas](https://github.com/carloslanderas))
- VRHelper now exposes onNewMeshPicked observable that will notify a PickingInfo object after meshSelectionPredicate evaluation
   ([carloslanderas](https://github.com/carloslanderas))
- `AssetsManager` will now clear its `tasks` lsit from all successfully loaded tasks ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))tasks ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- Added documentation to WebVRCamera and VRExperienceHelper ([trevordev](https://github.com/trevordev))
- Introduced `isStroke` on `HighlightLayerOptions` which makes the highlight solid ([PixelsCommander](https://github.com/pixelscommander))
- (Viewer) There is now an option to paste payload instead of a URL for configuration ([RaananW](https://github.com/RaananW))
- (Viewer) Models can be loaded async using JavaScript ([RaananW](https://github.com/RaananW))
- VRHelper will notify now onSelectedMeshUnselected observable to subscribers when the applied ray selection predicate does not produce a hit and a mesh compliant with the meshSelectionPredicate was previously selected
   ([carloslanderas](https://github.com/carloslanderas))
- (Viewer) initScene and initEngine can now be extended. onProgress during model loading is implemented as observable. ([RaananW](https://github.com/RaananW))
- glTF loader now supports the KHR_lights extension ([MiiBond](https://github.com/MiiBond))
- Added depth of field effect to default pipeline ([trevordev](https://github.com/trevordev))
- The observable can now notify observers using promise-based callback chain. ([RaananW](https://github.com/RaananW))
- Added base64 helper functions to `Tools` ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
- Added `createDefaultCamera` and `createDefaultLight` functions to `Scene` ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))
- Gulp process now supports multiple outputs when using webpack. ([RaananW](https://github.com/RaananW))
- (Viewer) Scene Optimizer intergrated in viewer. ([RaananW](https://github.com/RaananW))
- (Viewer) The viewer supports custom shaders in the configuration. ([RaananW](https://github.com/RaananW))
- Documented PostProcessRenderEffect, DefaultRenderingPipeline, BlurPostProcess, DepthOfFieldEffect, PostProcess, PostProcessManager classes ([trevordev](https://github.com/trevordev))
- SPS internal storage of each solid particle rotation matrix ([jbousquie](https://github.com/jbousquie)) 
- (Viewer) Introducing the viewer labs - testing new features. ([RaananW](https://github.com/RaananW))
- (Viewer) It is now possible to update parts of the configuration without rcreating the objects. ([RaananW](https://github.com/RaananW))

## Bug fixes
- Texture extension detection in `Engine.CreateTexture` ([sebavan](https://github.com/sebavan))
- Fixed a bug with merging vertex data ([bghgary](https://github.com/bghgary))

## Breaking changes
- Removed unused PostProcessRenderPass class and extended postProcessingRenderingEffect to support multiple PostProcesses ([trevordev](https://github.com/trevordev))
