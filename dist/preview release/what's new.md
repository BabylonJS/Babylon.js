    - class `MeshBuilder` documented ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
    - class `Mesh` documented ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
  - **Bug fixes**
    - Fixed bug with billboards and parenting ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - Fixed bug with ArcRotateCamera.setTarget ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - Fixed bug with OBJ Loader - All meshes were concatenated with the previous one ([Temechon](https://github.com/Temechon))
  - **Breaking changes**
    - `VertexData.CreateLines()` removed as `MeshBuilder.CreateLines()` now calls `MeshBuilder.CreateLineSystem()`
    - `scene.onNewXXXAdded` and `scene.onXXXRemoved` callbacks were removed and replaced by `scene.onNewXXXAddedObservable` and `scene.onXXXRemovedObservable`
    - `Material.dispose` does not dispose textures by default. You have to call `material.dispose(false, true)` to get the previous behavior.
