## Breaking changes
- `FollowCamera.target` was renamed to `FollowCamera.meshTarget` to not be in conflict with `TargetCamera.target` ([Deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
- `EffectRenderer.render` now takes a `RenderTargetTexture` or an `InternalTexture` as the output texture and only a single `EffectWrapper` for its first argument ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- Sound's `updateOptions` takes `options.length` and `options.offset` as seconds and not milliseconds ([RaananW](https://github.com/RaananW))
- HDRCubeTexture default rotation is now similar to the industry one. You might need to add a rotation on y of 90 degrees if you scene changes ([Sebavan](https://github.com/sebavan/))

- Rendering of transparent meshes: stencil state is now set to the value registered in the engine (when calling `engine.setStencilBuffer(value)`) instead of being set to `false` unconditionally. This change may affect the highlight layer when using transparent meshes. If you are impacted, you may need to exclude the transparent mesh(es) from the layer ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
