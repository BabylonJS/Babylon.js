## Breaking changes

- [List of breaking changes introduced by ou compatibility with WebGPU](https://doc.babylonjs.com/advanced_topics/webGPU/webGPUBreakingChanges)
    - [ReadPixels and ProceduralTexture.getContent are now async](https://doc.babylonjs.com/advanced_topics/webGPU/webGPUBreakingChanges#readpixels-is-now-asynchronous)
    - [Shader support differences](https://doc.babylonjs.com/advanced_topics/webGPU/webGPUBreakingChanges#shader-code-differences)
- Use both `mesh.visibility` and `material.alpha` values to compute the global alpha value used by the soft transparent shadow rendering code. Formerly was only using `mesh.visibility` ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- Depth renderer: don't render mesh if `infiniteDistance = true` or if `material.disableDepthWrite = true` ([Popov72](https://github.com/Popov72))
- Mesh.createInstance no longer make a unique Geometry for the Mesh so updating one Geometry can affect more meshes than before. Use Mesh.makeUniqueGeometry for old behaviour. ([breakin](https://github.com/breakin))
- Ammo.js needs to be initialized before creating the plugin with `await Ammo();` since Ammo introduced an async init in their library. ([sebavan](https://github.com/sebavan))
